8263,"Greg McKenzie is a guy who could be your neighbor. He works, he loves his wife and accompanies her to church. He's trying to quit smoking, hold his temper and not swear too much.Then suddenly, just home from a church-sponsored trip to the Holy Land, he and his wife, Jill, find themselves in the middle of a situation that could ignite World War 3.The plot reminds me somewhat of Hitchcock's Man Who Knew Too Much. The stories aren't the same, but there's that same tension and consequences for a character thrust into a situation involving a foreign culture and a place outside his normal life.Campbell builds the reader's sympathy for Greg and Jill McKenzie--they're a likeable couple, one we'd enjoy spending time with--and you want to see them get out of this dire situation.There's plenty of action as Greg, a man with a background in law enforcement, races against time to rescue his wife and avert an international tragedy. It keeps the reader flipping pages. We want to know what happens next and how they're going to be reunited.This was the first in a series and a good place to start if you're unfamiliar with Campbell's work. Good characterization, smooth plotting and even a touch of humor.",positive,book
5390,"I probably wouldn't have bought this book if it hadn't been listed for $.99, but I'm so glad I gave it a chance! It was worth every penny and now I want to read all the other books in the series. Chase Dagger, Sara and Einstein make a great detective team with good character development and budding chemistry, and the mystery was a fun page turner, if a tad predictable. Slight spoiler - while I'm a tad creeped out by the age difference (he's 35, she's 18) I'm hoping the author will give her a few years to grow up before taking the storyline that way. Can we get all of these on Kindle please?",positive,book

11392,"Pete Toleffson is in Konigsburg, Texas because his brother Cal has finally convinced his fiance Docia to have a wedding ceremony. He's Cal's best man, but he has no idea what a best man is supposed to do, exactly. He's pretty sure he's not supposed to punch his brother, but the impulse is there every time he catches sight of Calthorpe's ever-present and perpetually satisfied grin. It's not that Pete begrudges his brother's happiness, but Pete's in a strange town full of stranger people and ragged from his job as a county attorney - a job that he tends to obsess over...to the point that he can't remember the last time he took a vacation. Staying away from his email and voicemail while he's in Konigsburg takes conscious intensive effort, and he could buy stock in the antacid company that keeps his acid reflux in check. Supporting his brother through The Wedding from hell might just be his undoing.If sheer force of will and hard work can make The Wedding go as planned, Janie Dupree's life would be a lot less complicated. Unfortunately, everything about The Wedding seems destined to a calamitous end despite all her efforts and the best man is absolutely no help. Not to mention, he's rude. Cute though. But Janie's seeing someone...sort of...even if he is boring and self-involved. And then there's The Wedding, which is taking every single ounce of self control and mental fortitude to deal with.Just when Pete is starting to relax, and starting to more than notice Janie and even step up a little in his best man role, Toleffsons start to pour into Konigsburg and it becomes painfully clear that the town is definitely not big enough for all of them. Neither Pete nor Janie would put money on surviving The Wedding intact.Since stumbling acrossVenus in Blue Jeans: Konigsburg, Texas Book 1when it was offered as a free Kindle download on Amazon.com, I've become totally addicted to the town and inhabitants of Konigsburg, Texas, and thoroughly pleased with Meg Benjamin as an author. With a smooth, crisp writing style that highlights the strength of the series - the quirky characters that populate Konigsburg - and makes the narrative flow surprisingly well with whatever crazy situations those characters find themselves, Benjamin has a gem of a series on her hands. As I was withVenus in Blue Jeans, I was surprised and impressed with just how quick and fun a read Wedding Bell Blues is, and credit the author for both the fluidity of the narrative and the charm of the characters and setting.I liked Pete and Janie - perhaps not quite as much as Cal and Docia, but still they were a pleasure to read about. I don't think Pete's character was quite as well developed in the beginning of this book as Cal's had been in his, so the evolution of Pete's character from sourpuss jerk to nice guy was a bit subtle, but I enjoyed the results all the same. The Wedding is a good foil for the book, though the insular nature of wedding preparations did slightly diminish the role of the town and townspeople as the forces of nature they were in the first book. What it provided, however, was a surprisingly realistic and occasionally tragic conflict with the Toleffson and Dupree families' dynamic.There was little smooth about that dynamic. With one brother whose wife is a vapid trollop with the maternal instinct most cobras would envy, a mother who disapproves of everything and anything, and an eldest brother with far too much bad history to forgive, Pete's family was pretty much nightmarish. I didn't much care for the mother or the sister-in-law, but thought it was great storytelling. Janie's got some conflict with her mother over the guy she's seeing and she allows herself to be a bit of a doormat in a couple of places when being nice didn't serve her very well, but I actually know people just like her so there was definitely a sense of realism to her character.As much as I wish a couple of the less than pleasant people in the book got more of a comeuppance, I appreciated the story as a whole and was thrilled to see the direction it's taking. I had a bit of an issue in the previous book with the speed with which Cal and Docia got together, and for my personal preferences, the relationship between Pete and Janie developed in a far more pleasing time frame, right up until the end. There was a massive leap in development towards the end that seemed abrupt and precipitous, but overall I enjoyed the entirety of their relationship.I thinkVenus in Blue Jeanswas a bit more quirky in both character and story, and just a touch more charming because of it, but Wedding Bell Blues was a more complex tale that provided more depth with the familial issues and in my personal opinion, was more realistic with an overall better plot. I've become a huge fan of Benjamin and this series and am looking forward to continuing withBe My Baby: Konigsburg, Texas, Book 3. I've enjoyed the Toleffsons and love the town and people of Konigsburg. I can't wait to return. 4.5 Stars.Originally reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",positive,book

6953,"This fabulously written book drew me in.  Miranda's a little like the wife in the movie True Lies, she lives simply to take care of her husband the lightkeeper, and her two boys.  But she loves deeply, and she takes action when her husband disappears. She is naive and finds herself in a foreign world with the only resource of herself to rely upon.  She stumbles around not knowing what a morass she has placed herself into. Nothing is at it seems. She can't tell the good guys from the bad guys. This character development and plot is a study of subtlety. There is enough suspense and mystery to intrigue the reader to stick with Miranda. I love Miranda. I love devoted mothers and wives.  I really love that this author made the power of love be the guiding motivation for our heroine.  This is not an action genre book.  Which makes it all the more delicious.  This is a real life fantasy, sci-fi, magic story that you can't quite pin anywhere.  The writing is superb.  The reviewers who didn't like this book are probably needing 'in your face' stimulation that is fast and dramatic. This is a book to be savored and tasted. It's like engaging in high tea with Devon cream and croissants. You soak in the ambiance, smell the salt air, skirt the garbage and stay alert to being followed.  This is the most courageous of heroines because she diligently continues her search with her inadequate knowledge. She pieces together the mystery of her husband. She continues on in the face of complete unknowing - which is one of the greatest challenges we each face in our own world. She continues on even when everything she knows turns upside down. This book is a bestseller for a reason.  It is an amazing book.  I can not recommend it highly enough.",positive,book

10587,"This is probably the best buy on Amazon for a reader of classic science fiction.  H. Beam Piper foresees a human race with advanced technology and beginning to colonize planets throughout the galaxy. This collection of stories covers mankind's rise and fall of civilization and the exploration that takes place.  They cover the rise and fall of the Federation and the Interstellar Wars.H. Beam Piper was a visionary and an excellent author.  I enjoyed every page in this book.  I should really say that this is 12 books into one.  Not only are they well written and entertaining, they are illustrated.  While I enjoyed all of the stories my favorites were Space Viking, Four-Day Planet, Uller Uprising, The Cosmic Computer and the best to me was Little Fuzzy.I own many of these books in the original paperback format but I purchased the Kindle version to reread them and I am glad that I did.

2397,"This is actually a compilation of CI's How-To series. This was originally a couple of dozen small cookbooks including things like 'How to Make Cookie Jar Favorites' and 'How to Make Stew.' Basically each chapter in this book was an individual cookbook before. I've known, used, and loved CI for years. All of their recipes seem to be flawless to me. They do tons of test cooking and recipe development before allowing anything make it into print. I go to this one and the actual print copies which I also own, all the time for recipes.

4876,"As the book description describes, this is a collection of 6 novels that are part of a vampire series.  The first five books revolve around a group of vampires and their Chosen as well as a despicable branch of the CIA known as DPI.  We follow them through the trials and tribulations of love while being hunted by the DPI.  The final book that is part of this collection revolves around another vampire and his Chosen.Each of these stories were well-written and I found myself fully pulled into each story.  With the first story, I became involved with the characters and really grew to love them as the stories continued.  In the first five, each story built on the last one and I got to know each previous character more than before as well as be introduced to know characters.This box set is a highly-enjoyable read and I look forward to the reading the second set as soon as I can afford it.

This book has a lot of action but it also has a great &#34;book worm&#34; factor with all of Abby's research. I really like how the author incorporated alot of truthful tidbits into the story, several of which I hadn't run across in the general knowlege base of Kennedy conspiracies. It wasn't a rehash and even though some of the action was a bit unbelivable and I had a hard time accepting some of the later characters like Rob and Demetrius, overall it was a very solid book with good strong lead characters. I think a few more sprinklings of &#34;the times&#34; would have made it more authentic- several of the later scenes in the college town felt too modern for me, seeing as how the story took place in the early 80s, but maybe that's just me!

The storyline of Belora's (Maiden Flight) mother, Adora finding love after she has been a widow for 10 years is wonderful particularly when the man she meets is also a widower who lost his family. The meddling of the dragons is cute and very astute.The only fault I found was the story of her lost twin daughters being told several times, yes, it did move the story forward but it could have been better condensed.The introduction of new characters was handled well and the enemy king and his plans was well thought out and a great plot twist.

408,"From the ""Cascadia Wolves"" series. Preceded byStandoff. Followed byTrinity.Plot:Shane has always denied his werewolf heritage. He lives as a human and prefers it that way. Megan has embraced her ""otherness""; she is a werewolf and proud of it. When fate mates them, they need to find a way to deal with their differences, or live apart.Comments:- A reasonable length book (2650 kindle locations).- Preceding books followed a ""Werewolf Mafia"" story arc. It was wound up in ""Standoff"". ""Fated"" would standalone, the other books are not necessary for the enjoyment/understanding of this book. However, as characters from other books appear and play an integral role in ""Fated"", reading the books in sequence would be of benefit.- ""Fated"" begins 2 years after ""Standoff"".- Shane was Layla's anchor inReluctant. He has not appeared in other books. Megan is the last Warden sister of the Cascadia Wolves Pack to be mated and is Lex's Enforcer.- The earlier books in the series (other than ""Reluctant"") mixed the action/suspense of the Pellini arc with romance/wooing/angst of newly mated relationships. As the war no longer exists, ""Fated"" is all about the relationship. It is chock-full of emotion, angst, hope, heartbreak. And lots of sex. No violence, no shooting, no war.- Sex is m/f with a very HOT m/f/m encounter. Sex is all loving, generous.Opinion:Yes, I like this series of books. I think Dane brings originality as well as humour and love to the Shifter/paranormal genre. The sex is always HOT and the characters are always well-defined and interesting. The women are STRONG, physically, emotionally. They stand up for themselves and don't let anyone walk over them. The men (heroes) are Alpha, they want their women to be protected. But they always love and celebrate their strengths, differences and power. Shane, in ""Fated"", struggles with the differences, because he struggles with his own. But Megan knows who she is and what she wants and fights for it. Another fabulous book in the Cascadia series.",positive,book

I've read many of Jules Verne's works, and I can sat that I was thoroughly amused the whole time I was reading this book. I've come to the realization that very few writers today even come close to the marvelous works that were wrought by hands such as Jules Verne. Would I recommend it? YES!

4224,"Neglected as a child and subjected to countless disappointments, Jessica Evans doesn't want to believe in either love or relationships.  Determined to keep true feeling at bay, Jessie uses m&eacute;nages with her best friend Clancy and other men as a safety net.  She can enjoy the dominance she craves in the bedroom, but on her own terms.  But Jessie's safety net is torn away from her when Wade Peterson asks her to marry her.  Though she turns Wade down, Jessie still can't get him out of her mind.  And if the struggle to tamp down on her feelings for Wade wasn't hard enough, Jessie's past soon resurfaces with additional complications that unsettle her hard won control.Wade is crushed when the woman he loves rejects his marriage proposal.  However, the sexy-as-sin cowboy isn't about to give up so easily.  He might be willing to share Jessie with Clancy to keep her, for now, but the desire to have Jessie only for himself soon becomes too much.  Will Wade be able to win Jessie's trust and show her that true love and happily ever afters can exist?Mackenzie McKade does it again!  Bound by the Past is an emotional, engaging, sensual read I could not put down.  Wade is meltingly sexy, patient, dominant, and loving - the epitome of the perfect hero.  In the hands of a lesser author I might have become frustrated with Jessie and her determination to stay distanced from Wade.  However, Ms. McKade made me understand Jessie's fears and sympathize with her.  I adored her and loved watching her grow into someone who was able to accept love and give it in return.  As for Clancy, Jessie's best friend and the third in the couple's threesomes, he has me crying out for his story.  He's kind but tormented, supportive of his friends but in need of someone to love him and help him overcome his own past.Bound by the Past is the second in the Ties That Bind series, but can be read as a stand alone.  There is a brief mention of the hero and heroine of the first book, Bound for the Holidays, but having not read that book (yet), I don't feel I missed anything for this particular tale.  I dearly hope Ms. McKade continues this series with books for Clancy and Wade's siblings.At turns tender and titillating, Bound by the Past is a book I Joyfully Recommend.  Ms. McKade delivers a fantastic, blazingly hot tale with characters that will capture your heart and a romance that is truly sigh worthy.Shaynareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",positive,book

What a pleasant surprise, to read such a well-written story.  True, there are a few spots where the editing could have been a bit better (at one point the main character is lying on his back, then all of a sudden he's on his front), but these small blemishes did not take away from the beautiful language of the piece and the clever plot (and twist at the end, which I won't spoil!).

1997,"Torn by Christina Brunkhorst is a wonderful romance with an interracial vibe. Ms. Brunkhorst provides the reader with a love story so real, you feel as though you are a part of the drama. The  key setting is in Montana, Big Sky country in all of its majesty.  I related to the small town feel after spending two summers in Missoula, Montana.  Her main character, Chelesa also spent a week in Montana and hence the beginning her a romance with her husband. They make a loving and beautiful family. I loved all of the characters. Ms. Brunkhorst invents them as if she were a supreme being molding and shaping them. Her rich vocabulary and smooth writing style draws in a reader who enjoys utilizing their critical and logical thinking skills. Torn touches all five senses. The love scene may leave you breathless and it did me. Jake, Chelsea's kind-hearted husband is almost a perfect human being. Tyler Benson is awesome in mind, body and soul. Ms. Brunkhorst's secondary characters are as important as the main characters because of their reactions to the events as the story unfolds. These incidents captivate and shake up situations, making the rising action so meaningful. I love the manner in which Ms. Burkhorst inserts drama on top of drama but with flair and lacking confusion and many surprises that touch everyone in Torn in a powerful way. Torn's great ending placed a smile on my face and an indelible mark on my heart. Ms. Burkhorst is a writer to watch and I am a new fan. In my honest opinion, Torn is a terrific book and worth the seven years it took Ms. Burkhorst to concoct such an entertaining, engrossing tale.Ms. Brunkhorst, thanks for making this week-end a peaceful, relaxing one with this book.",positive,book

I smiled, worried, laughed, agonized and cried along with the characters and wanted nothing more than for them to all have a happily-ever-after. Ms. Banks has a `mystical' spin on shifters that really captures my interest and definitely has me eager to pick up any and all future books she writes.AMBER EYES is the sequel to GOLDEN EYES, which was released through another publisher so be sure to stop by Ms. Banks' website to discover the `rest of the story' or at least the rest of it so far.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",positive,book
1054,"Maya Banks is one of my favorite authors and Stay With Me does not disappoint.  This menage story begins with the trio already together and living their lives as a family.  Logan and Rhys are married to Catherine.  They are hard workers and devoted to their growing sucessfull business, but this is the reason that their wife Catherine is unhappy.  It seems the guys have been so single-minded in their pursuit of success that they have been neglecting poor Catherine.  On their anniversary she plans a romantic dinner at a restaurant so that she can tell them that she is pregant with their child.  They guys get caught up in a business problem and forget the dinner date.  They have to fly out to solve the problem and also cancel a planned Jamaican vacation with Catherine.  This is the last straw for Catherine and she heads to Jamaica without them.  When they discover that she isn't waiting for them at home, they realize just how much they have hurt her and fly to Jamaica to try to win her back.  This was a very romantic menage story.  The guys are hot and the reader realizes that they work hard for Catherine because the three began their lives together very humbly.  Catherine makes them realize that nothing is as important as their relationship together.  The changes they make to their workaholic lifestyles reveal the extent of their love for Catherine and results in a very touching, and sexy story.  Well done from Ms. Banks, as usual!",positive,book

2026,"Lissa decided to ignore her queer feelings about getting on the hotel shuttle.  She needed to find another position, and it was the only way to make it to the job conference.  What follows next is a near death experience that changes her life forever when a gorgeous vineyard owner rescues her.Atticus Maxwell is a vampire enforcer who's lived for centuries, yearning and hoping for the One to bring meaning to his life.  Meeting Lissa knocks him out of his ennui once he's awakened to an all encompassing love.  Could she be the One he's searched for?  Once it's learned that the accident was no accident, Atticus does everything in his power to ensure that Lissa stays alive long enough for them to explore all the possibilities.Most of the vampire novels I tend to steer towards are usually dark, violent, brutal and brimming with lurid sex (think JR Ward), which makes them not quite as emotionally romantic as One and Only.  This delightfully sweet paranormal romance carried an ""R in Romantic"" timeless vibe.  Sure the sex is sensual, at times even naughty, but the amiable warmth here is old school.  It's not in the bodice ripper class; there's definitely violin and piano music serenading reader heartstrings.Atticus is noble and honorable with that air of Byronic tragedy that makes him vulnerable without being a stuffy wimp.  When he opens his heart and life to the equally lonely and engaging Lissa, I was so glad they finally found one another.  There's a tender thread throughout that works well with themes of friendship, loyalty, and hope, as well as the continuing battle of good vs. evil.  All in all, I was left with a pleasant feeling, which means I'd like to see where this series goes.  Bianca D'Arc does well setting everything up for the next series installment, and I'm positive that she'll more than deliver on it.  If that doesn't convince you, take a look at the mesmerizing delectable cover.Patrice F.Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",positive,book

If you haven't followed the series which includes 3 books prior then it would seem a bit rushed and confusing. This novella is a good read but not strong enough to stand on it's own. I think that's why so many reviewers are disappointed with the read.Jena's best friends in past books have all met and married their true mate. At one of their weddings she happens to meet Ian. Though they briefly spoke and shared a dance, she is unable to stop thinking about Ian who is a vampire. Ian has been watching Jena for months.

He spoke what was on mind and found myself smiling and liking it. I felt bad for him at times because like Hunt I have a scar on my face from a car accident and I was embarrassed by it and sometime I'm still am, so I related to the character so much. I loved Lila character as well she tried her best not to fall for him while trying to keep her dignity. I like that the ""Write"" didn't make them fall in love so quick and like I said the honesty of Hunter and plain-spokenness is so needed in others writers' characters.

9386,"I don't review many romance novels though I read a ton of them. This author is really a good writer. It's not just a story but prose that is touching and pulls you in yet without being heavy or feeling intentional. She did a nice job at mixing an old-world setting with a slightly more modern conversational tone. I was very interested in the story and how it would turn out (hoped for the best), and if she had another book focusing on the nature of the hero I'd buy that one as well, as I found it an interesting twist on the archetype, but I think from her booklist most her stuff is the more classical romance novel. Interesting and touching and kept my attention. And (thank god) does not suffer the modern kindle-affliction of 'story ends at a teaser go buy the next one in series' -- it's a complete book to itself.",positive,book
5796,"This turned out to be my favorite story in the anthology,Hearts from the Ashes.  I found the idea of an alpha and omega werewolf romance to be refreshing.  Yes, Laney is very much like an uke in a traditional yaoi story - but, I like yaoi.  He is a little effeminate, which may seem stereotypical, but there are men like this. Certainly not all gay men, or even all ""bottoms.""  Yet, I rarely see readers griping about how so many romances have strong, handsome men either - why aren't they short and ugly to avoid being stereotypical? Because this is a fantasy romance not real life!  Laney's clumsiness is a little over the top, but his relationship with Dev is sweet and hot.  I would have liked the characters to be more developed, but this is a short story not a novel.

A voice that only has a name but not a face.  That is about to end as he and the rest of the group have been called into meeting in New York City.  Tony knows that Charlotte is efficient and calm in all circumstances; he also knows that she can be ruthless and guesses that she is a matronly lady.Charlotte Rhames is the executive assistant to the Devlin Group, a job she loves and is respected at.  She knows most people take her for only how she appears: rich and beautiful.  Charlotte can't wait to meet Tony. She knows everything about him, but has never actually met the man.  Charlotte has many expectations for their meeting, which she is hoping, ends in her home.Tony is stunned when he actually discovers the person behind the voice is the young and sexy woman who came to pick him up.  This shock is just the beginning of the events that will put the entire Devlin Group on high alert.  When the group is attacked, they discover it was an inside job.  Charlotte knows she is the only one who can get to the person behind the attack, but it will mean going back into a world she swore never to visit again.  Tony won't let Charlotte go into danger alone, but when things go horribly wrong, both of them have to depend on the voices and abilities of the people on the other end of the links.On the Edge brings back the characters from the Devlin Group and this time is Charlotte's turn to get her happy ever after.  But when you are a member of this group, nothing is ever easy and that includes love.  Tony has been put down most of his life because of his background - the same one that makes him perfect in his undercover work.  Charlotte has worked hard over the years to remove herself from her past and now she must face it again to save the others.  Danger feeds passion, and Tony and Charlotte already had the flames rising even before the danger happened.  I was never happier than when Tony and Charlotte made it out okay only to have them tear each other apart.  It made me want to knock their heads together, but I was rewarded in the end with a perfect ending.  Suspense stories have always been able to hold me in their grip. Ms. Stacey did one even better and wouldn't let me put the book down until the last word had been read.  On the Edge is sexy, full of danger, and has two main characters I just had to back.

9153,"Having an intense interest in the Holocaust for most of my adult life, this book was an easy choice when it popped up on my Kindle. I expect to feel disgust, anger and sadness when reading accounts of the Holocaust-what I didn't expect was how this book made me examine myself, and analyze what I believe in my heart...I am struggling to put into words what I am feeling, but I will try...Sol makes the point when talking to the priest that Christians have been taught from birth that the only way is through Christ, and they are all anti-Semitic, even if sub-consciously... I consider myself a Christian, but was not raised in any particular ""religion""- as a result, I only have the Bible to go on, where it is repeatedly said that the Jews are Gods Chosen people... I can't imagine that has changed. God is not fickle. Is God going to refuse the Jewish people, who also love and serve Him? If I thought that were possible than maybe He isn't a God I want to serve...As long as anyone is condemning someone else for having a different belief system than their own, we are doomed to repeat history. There are many paths to God. It makes me cringe when any one religion claims theirs' is the ONLY way. We need to embrace each other, as equal children of God, and remember that the Greatest Commandment is LOVE. Who are we to judge another?I highly recommend this book.

5542,"This is one of the top 5 Harlequin Presents books I have ever read, and I have read a lot of them. I think the best part of this book is that it is presented in a new way.It doesn't have the normal plot of jealous ex's or false pregnancy claims on the hero. This book shows how far a family is will to go to follow traditions and what they feel is in the best interest of their family even at the expense of hurting those involved in the deception. It shows how much Luc is willing to give because he regretted his past choices of those he believed wouldn't do him wrong. I loved how Skye wasn't selfish and realized how much Luc was sacrificing, even though he told her he didn't care. It shows how much she truly loves him. She took the initiative to try and correct past wrongs even though they were against her. It takes a lot of courage and love to do what she did.

6036,"Eastern Texas, 1879At the age of five, Emma Radcliff made the monumental announcement that she is going to marry Rafe Sinclair.  She's done a lot of growing up in the fifteen years since then and has decided that she's not going to marry at all.  Wearing breeches and working horses on her father's ranch suits her just fine.  Only her plans are thwarted when her father insists that she marry Rafe - no if's, and's, or but's.Rafe Sinclair really has no interest in getting married but a stipulation in his grandfather's will forces the issue.  He has to be married by the time he turns thirty or he loses the Circle S Ranch.  Since he's known Emma her entire life she seems like a relatively safe choice but the last thing he anticipates is the little hellcat's insistence that he agree to stay out of her bed.  To make matters worse, little Emma is looking mighty gown up and he's just discovered that he wants her - in every way.Since Emma insists on her no sex clause, Rafe counters her with a clause of his own - that she reserves the right to change her mind and void her clause at any time.  Though still not entirely comfortable with the situation Emma agrees but also requests that she be allowed to work with the horses at the Triple R. They'll both have what they want - well almost.  Things don't go exactly according to plan.  Emma's father refuses to allow her to return to work the horses after the marriage takes place, she counterattacks with the insistence that she takes some of the horses with her.Rafe and Emma marry but no sooner are the vows spoken then the trouble starts.  Emma's always been very attracted to Rafe and Rafe is definitely finding it difficult to adhere to her `no marital privileges' clause.  What's a guy to do when he discovers that is new wife is the sexiest thing on two legs?  Well being a man of his word, he can't just grab her up and take her to his bed, he's going to have to seduce her.  Only Emma's just as stubborn as he is persuasive.  Which one will hold out the longest?Beth Williamson presents readers with yet another wonderful historical tale with her contribution to the LEATHER AND LACE series - BRANDED.  Emma won me over from the very first page.  She's so `in-your-face' and not afraid to go against convention that I couldn't wait to read all about her and find out how or even if Rafe can `tame' her.  Rafe grew up knowing Emma so of course he's never seen her in any sort of sexual way but he's seeing her now and practically salivating just thinking about bedding his own wife.  Ms. Williamson even throws in several supporting characters that you'll love to hate or hate to love, but in either case they're definitely unique and fun.Be sure to keep an eye out for the other LEATHER AND LACE series books.

10789,"Belle Taylor has her life carefully mapped out.  She's been making goal oriented lists her entire life and never once has she failed to reach each milestone and feel a sense of accomplishment as she marks it off the `TO DO LIST.'  For the first time ever her goal of a plush corner office and her name on the letterhead of the law firm where she's been working has her considering altering her plans.  She's been working eighty hour weeks for the past year and Belle's just beginning to realize that the perks of her desired position may not be worth the sacrifices she's made.Rafe Bettencourt, Belle's brother Brian's best friend, has been a longstanding friend of the family and the object of Belle's fantasies since she was twelve years old.  It wasn't until five years ago that he began to view her as a desirable woman - before that she was simply Brian's little sister and a whole lot of fun to torment.  Rafe's perfectly aware of Belle's anal retentive, control freak nature but that's a trait he's begun to find very alluring about her - there's nothing he'd like more than to strip her naked and make her lose control.For the first time in a year, Belle has returned home to visit with her family for the holidays.  She's thinner and paler than she had been on previous visits and everyone points out the fact that she's had no time for herself, family, or anything else that makes life worth living.  Belle's perfectly aware of that fact but she's come so far and is so close to her goal - quitting now is simply inconceivable.  Rafe proves to be a delightful distraction from her own troubles as he tempts her to be naughty with him.  What better time to start up a little romance than Christmas and seeing as she'll be visiting for a full five days, he's determined to give her a good reason to make some adjustments to her `TO DO LIST.'  Adjustments that include him, a happily ever after, and all the organizing and list making she could ever desire - as long as he can seduce her into giving up her `dreams' of success in San Francisco.  Or had she already been coming to the conclusion that there's more to life than a corner office and empty apartment all on her own?  Rafe just may provide that extra push she needs to take the leap of faith and move one of her long term goals up a few notches.Lauren Dane will have readers smiling with this delightful tale of hope and promise.  TO DO LIST captures Belle's single-minded pursuit of her dreams and her lists with humor and a little sadness.  There's no doubt that she's well on her way to acquiring her goal, but she also realizes that it isn't worth giving up her `real' life to achieve and accepting that she isn't going to get to cross that goal off her list is difficult to accept.  Rafe is willing to accept Belle exactly as she is - organized shoes and all - but he's also aware that the path she's on is a destructive and lonely one.  Rather than try to tell her what she should do he presents her with feasible options which may make her happier.  I had a great time reading TO DO LIST especially since I'm guilty of making these infamous lists myself.  I loved the family aspect of this story and the way it makes you see that there are more important things in life than reaching every goal you set for yourself - there's health, family, love, and your own happiness.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",positive,book

9408,"Dr. Thorndyke has remained something of a hidden treasure, known only by mystery freaks who sought the out-of-print books by his creator, R.Austin Freeman in the now almost mythical musty, dusty used bookshops of (it seems like) only a few years ago.But that has all changed. In recent years, Freeman's works began appearing in trade pb editions on amazon. They were a good deal at around $6.00 apiece. So, shaking the dust from my hair, I bought a bunch of them. I should have waited till I got a kindle last Christmas.To illustrate my point, the ebook I am now recommending to you costs $.99. It consists of 3 novels and a short story collection. I probably paid $35-$40 (including shipping) I guess. Something you can get on kindle now for less than $1.00.But forget the money for now. Here is your chance to get turned on to perhaps the greatest detective of all time. Don't shout ""heresy"" yet, Holmesians. I'm a great fan of the world's first consulting detective too.

Because Kalleysten has taken the time to develop these interesting characters, it was easy to purchase the next book in the series.  (I was given a copy of Blurred Nights in exchange for an honest review.) Although I have to admit I would like to see certain characters end up together, I can't wait to see how the rest of the story is written.

4263,"Jolene Benate has had to put her life completely back together over the last six years right after she was told her husband was dead.  Now she is a deputy marshal on an elite warrant team.  It's not been an easy road and Jo has succeeded, if you don't count the fact she can't move on from the love of her deceased husband.Paul Benate gave up Jo in a move he thought would prevent her from ever being harmed.  Paul has a brain that many would love to control and while he likes working for the military, he missed Jo every day these last six years.  When a report shows that Jo has been found and is a target, Paul demands to get back all he lost.When Jo and Paul meet again, the fireworks are many and pointed.  Jo is hurt and angry that she was lead to believe Paul was dead.  Paul wants to begin again, but first he has to convince Jo to both forgive him and to understand.  Love brought them together and drove them apart. Now when the danger to Jo seems to follow her, will love be enough to give Paul and Jo another chance?Still Mine has several of my favorite aspects in a story: hot sexy scenes, engaging main characters, and enough suspense that it makes you want to read quickly to find out the ending.  Jo has grown up and found a career even while loving the husband she believes is dead.  Paul made a decision he thought would save Jo from danger and was given a second chance.  From the moment they met face-to-face, I was drawn in and could not flip the pages fast enough.  Even before giving in to their passion, I could feel the strength of it.  I was quickly reminded that the emotions that give passion can produce equal fear and anger.  Watching Jo and Paul try and work out the past to hopefully lead to a new future for them showed me that a true and deep love never really dies.  When the danger comes from an unexpected angle, at least for me, I loved seeing the depth of the trust that had been restored between Paul and Jo.  Still Mine is equal parts hot romance and suspense, which I found not to be missed.  The cliffhanger ending leads me to hope that just maybe Jo and Paul will show up again soon in another book.Joreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",positive,book

11694,"I love Timothy Zahn's work!  He does what no other writer, not even George Lucas himself can do.  He takes the rank and file Storm Troopers and gives them personalities, talents, skills and makes them multi-dimensional characters that people can get invested in.Where most writers show the Storm Troopers as faceless cannon fodder who can't hit anything with their blasters, Zahn shows them as competent sharpshooting elite commandos who can think on their feet and adapt to any situation as well as follow orders.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***So the story is a pretty basic one.  There is an alien warlord who is ruling a planet with an iron fist, and the Empire decides it is time to go and free the plant of his rule, so they dispatch the 501st Legion a.k.a. Vader's Fist to take him down.There is something I do wonder about though, this takes place after Vader is dead, and after Thrawn's rule has ended.  So why does the 501st Legion keep calling themselves ""Vader's Fist?""  Vader's not around anymore?  Do they keep the name just for the sake of nostalgia?  It's not really a major gripe, just something that makes me scratch my head.Our main characters are three Storm Troopers who all have different skills and specialties.  They infiltrate the warlord's fortress and meet up with some of the local freedom fighters and strike a deal with them.  If the troopers help them free their imprisoned comrades, they will help the troopers get inside and take out the warlord's troops and bring him to justice.The troopers agree and they infiltrate the stronghold together.  Later it seems the rebels have betrayed the Storm Troopers, but it turns out it is just a very elaborate ruse and the rebels were always on the side of the troopers and the prisoners are freed and the warlord is captured by the Empire and brought to justice.Later the head of the rebels is offered a position in the 501st Legion, which is awesome!  It really helps to enforce the fact that the Empire has learned that just having humans in their military doesn't help, it's a hindrance and it was the main reason the Rebel Alliance was able to defeat them.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Zahn gives us action, gun fights, intrigue and a little bit of politics as well in this story.

4726,"This is not what I typically read, but I am glad I saw it and downloaded it to read.  It wasn't` a quick read, the subject is too sad for anyone with sensitivity or heart to rush through.  I stopped frequently, because I couldn't see through my tears and I couldn't stop them.  Patricia Halloff has written a book as memorable and touching as ""WHERE THE RED FREN GROWS.""  Sissypuss is told from a feline's point of view, utilizing the voices of several memorable cats that were part of the main characters' too short, too tragic life.  It is a book that every animal lover should read and pass on to others in the hope that the world can become a more humane place for all of its inhabitants.I've loved animals ever since I can remember, but my mother was allergic to cats so I couldn't have one until I had my own home.  Since then I`ve always had at least one cat and usually a dog also.  My daughter loved animals as much as I did, but she was partial to cats.  I believe it was because they recognized the loving, proud, independent nature they each shared.I know that there are people that torment animals just because they can and organizations that claim they are doing it as research and I hope that in the future that those who perform these acts will be severely punished here by law and in the afterlife.  I also would like to see the people who dump pregnant or unwanted litters of animals out to die punished severely.  This beautiful book sheds light onto a subject that we would prefer to ignore, but in doing so, we are condemning more animals to a cruel, senseless fate that will eventually lead to death, but not before, they have suffered too long at the hands of their tormentors.**UPDATE: June 2013: After much contemplation, I have decided to change how I rate the books I read. I feel that this is necessary for two primary reasons; there are too many high rated reviews from ""SP's and or friends of the author. Secondly, we are limited by Amazon's rating system which I feel needs to be changed but until then this is my only option. My standards for the stars, (noted in the title of review), are shown below:**5 STARS: This will be for books that I consider outstanding, meaning that I will keep the version I have to reread again.4 STARS: Books I would have previously rated as 5 will be 4.50 or higher and books under 4.50 will be the same as Amazon's 4 (I Like It).3 STARS: Books I would have previously rated as 4 will be 3.50 or higher; books under 3.50: will be the same as Amazon's 3 (It's OK, recommend).2 STARS: Books I would have previously rated as 3 will be 2.50 or higher; books under 2.50: it was good enough to finish, not recommend.1 STAR: Books I would have previously rated as 2 will be 1.50 or higher; books under 1.50: I didn't like it, but eventually I finished it; books under 1.50: I did not like it and may not have finished reading, not recommend.0-STARS: Need I say more.

1456,"Bobby Blackhawk and Cale Yancey have shared the dream of owning a small ranch since they met in Ag class in high school.  After a stint in the military they finally had the funds to make their dream a reality.  Their place is located in the Colorado mountains.  During snowstorms the route to town from their home is impossible.  Fortunately in lieu of a female during these times Bobby and Cale are more than compatible and have no qualms about helping each other out if and when the need arises.After catching her fianc&eacute; cheating on her again, Katherine Duvall makes the decision to escape the intolerable situation.  She leaves behind her engagement ring, grabs the rental car keys and drives off completely ignoring the bell staff's warning about driving without snow chains in the stormy weather - and that almost proved to be detrimental.Fortunately for Kate, Bobby and Cale are on their way home from town when they notice her vehicle and become concerned because it's obvious she isn't used to driving in snowy weather.  The men follow the other car for ten miles and just when they think she might make it and not slide off into the river it happens - her car fishtails and slides off the road into the freezing water.When it becomes obvious that Kate isn't thinking straight enough to save herself, Bobby goes into the water to rescue her.  It falls to Cale to get Bobby and the woman back to the truck and then to their home where he strips them all down and climbs into bed between them to use his own body heat to warm them up.  He just never anticipated they'd end up sharing so much more - though he certainly isn't complaining!Delilah Devlin's storylines never fail to pull readers into the story and SADDLED is no exception.  Bobby and Cale have very different personalities and expectations so it's extremely interesting how they respond both individually and together toward Kate.  Kate displays a vulnerability and honesty that really drew me to her.  Of course the sex scenes are scorching and adventurous with the perfect blend of emotional turmoil to ensure readers keep Ms. Devlin's name at the top of their `must read' list.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",positive,book

Caught in a massive storm they are carried thousands of miles and land on a remote island with no inhabitants.  They begin to build what life they can and they are very creative and ingenious. Their adventures are what make this story so entertaining.

10127,"This is the first Allan Quartermain book I've read, and it certainly won't be the last.  In fact, I just started reading King Solomon's Mines.The Kindle formatting was OK for this.  The one gripe I had is that there were various end notes that were really at the end of the book.  Because it's kind of hard to turn real pages and then flip back, it would have been nice if the notes had been at the ends of chapters.However, since this version was free, I'm not going to dock it a star.  There weren't that many notes anyway, and they weren't that vital to the story.This is the story of Allan Quartermain's last adventure.  He, Sir Henry Curtis, and Commander John Good go in search of a lost city of white people in Africa.  There is also Umslopagaas, a Zulu ex-chief/warrior, who might be my favorite character.  I hope he shows up in another Allan Quartermain novel.  (Curtis & Good are also in King Solomon's Mines, and so far, Umslopagaas has been mentioned, but I don't know if he'll actually show up.)The book is a lot of fun.

These are not serials.  Each stands on its own and the characters are fresh and exclusive.  I cannot identify a moral to this story, just as I can't say that there are no similarities with his other storylines; the ones I've read featuring a clean living protagonist whose politics lean a bit to the left and who are not adverse to a roll in the hay with a lusty female.

Zangara made Seaton House an exclusive hotel in the nineteen thirties and was later convicted of being a serial killer.

Arriving at Seaton House during a thunderstorm, Lottie meets Simon and falls instantly in lust but Simon clearly wants nothing to do with her.  Lottie's not giving up though; she plans to discover the mystery surrounding the house and Simon, all while trying to seduce him into bed, but strange things are happening.

5713,"Warning to all ladies who'll read this book: you'll fall in love with Brody.  He's sensitive, not a jerk like so many harlequin leading men, and still curls your toes.  This book was so much more than what I expected, I was incredibly surprised.  There was intrigue, family drama, humour, and lots of depth in the development of the characters in book.  There were no clear good and bad guys, just shades of grey that make the book really interesting.  Great Read!",positive,book
9220,"Sometimes I'm not sure whether a long drawn out epilogue would live up to my expectation because just being happy with a lot of sex doesn't make up a good read. But Reason Enough really did blew me away with only 45 pages. Damn. Megan Hart is still able to make me feel so much with only a novella. She cramped a few hot sex scene, Elle's inner turmoil on her decision whether to have a child or not and all sorts of emotion running through her in a few short pages.Dan is amazing as always, isn't he always is? Elle and Dan are now married and he is bringing up the question of having a baby. Elle instantly balked at the idea, she had made a terrible mum. Dan who is always being patience towards her didn't pressure her on the issue.We get to catch up on Elle's relationship with her mum and brother, Chad. We also got Marcy, who is now so very pregnant with her first child. Is great to see Elle surrounded herself with friends and family and all the love.

7966,"This is quite a strange book that I still have trouble to classify. First of all the main hero, Brock, was straight for two/third of the book and then he didn't fall in love physically for the other hero Carey, but rather he decided that Carey is a good man, better than all the other people around, and so he wanted to stay with him. On the other hand, Carey was the same, he didn't fall for Brock as a man, but rather as the image the man is for him.Brock is a poster boy of the past; in his early twenties his career is just finished, burnt like thousands of others in the modeling world. He is broken and without a place to stay, and he has no friend to turn for help... and maybe he doesn't want to neither. Then he meets Carey, a 32 years old independent wealthy man; Carey is strange, but he is gentle and caring, and he offers to help Brock for nothing. Neither Brock or Carey are gay, and Carey's offer raises not from a sexual interested, but more from an esthetically point of view: Carey is a wanna-be photographer, and he really likes Brock's easiness in front of the camera. So from their bargain, both of them will have what they want, Brock a place to stay and Carey a free model.When I say that I found strange this book, is due to the fact that for most of the book, Brock is regretting his lost sweetheart from high school or remembering his sexual experiences with women; never he lusts for Carey in a sexual way, if not with a light comment on Carey's muscular body after their exercised together, like a buddy friend could do in a gym.Also Carey is not easy to understand. I believe he helped Brock out of a need for company, he is lonely and without a real interest in life, and play the role of the Good Samaritan with Brock could give him a sense for his life.The book is rather short, less than 80 pages, in fact it's a novella, not a novel. But as I said I find it puzzling but not without interest. So puzzling that pushes me to browse the net to find info on the author, Dan Skinner, and I found a Dan Skinner who is a romance cover artist (like Carey) and who started his career helping a buddy friend with his modeling career (like Brock)...",positive,book

10021,This is the first book in the Heroes of Silver Springs. I totally loved this book. I couldn't put it down once I started it. I loved how these two people came back together after years of being apart. I must admit it made me think of the guy I was crushing on when I was in High School wondering what he thought of me. LOL. I loved how Veronica has become her own woman and has decided to do what she wants and feels like doing instead of what others expect of her and want her to do. I loved how she was able to knock Dean off balance from the beginning. I really enjoyed watching these two people learn about each other and fall in love.

6257,"Left to die by her werewolf mates after they are convinced she betrayed them and killed their father, Heather survives against the odds, though without the men she loves more than life itself, her soul feels dead inside.Now Cael and Riyu have learned the truth, and realize their own terrible betrayal of their beautiful mate.  They will do anything to make it up to Heather and earn her forgiveness, but is it too late?  Has her trust in them been irrevocably broken?Leave it to Maya Banks to have me bawling my eyes out over the Christmas holiday.  With her holiday release, Love Me, Still, Ms. Banks tore my heart to shreds.  Between my past experience with this author's stories and the publisher's synopsis, I really should have expected as much, in hindsight.Never has Maya Banks' ability to instill empathy for her characters in the reader been more evident than in this story.  I felt everything that Heather felt.  I ached when she ached for the loss of her mates.  I sobbed when she cried over the hurt she saw in her mates' eyes when they believed she had betrayed them.  And when they returned to her, I felt the same joy Heather did at her return to the mates and the pack she so cherished.In the midst of all that raw emotion, it never occurred to me what the story didn't have.  It wasn't until later as I reminisced over the story that it struck me - this is the first Maya Banks title I have ever read that has no sex scene.  You read that right - none whatsoever.  And you know what?  As much as I have enjoyed this author's undeniable talent at crafting love scenes that would melt the paint off a car, I didn't even notice it wasn't there while I read the story.  It worked very well without it.  In fact, I would venture so far to say that if adding a sex scene to this story meant cutting any other part of the tale, I would absolutely not want it.  Love Me, Still was that perfect.  If anyone should doubt Maya Banks' writing talent, this story can be held up as a prime example of her ability to stir emotions without needing sex to do so.When I am in the mood for a good tearjerker with a beautiful love story featuring the reuniting of lovers, Love Me, Still will be the book I reach for time and again.**This story can also be found in the print anthologyThe Perfect Gift**",positive,book

7420,"Ten years before Lucas was a young high school teacher just out of college; he was the classical teacher who liked to be more a friends than a authoritative figure for his students, but he did that without second thoughts. Problem was that one of his student was an unstable teen who probably would need a psychiatric help and instead his family didn't take with the right seriousness the problem. Riley, the student, approached Lucas and when the man refused him, all went to hell: Lucas was raped and left for dead in a burning cabin. He managed to survive and to denounce Riley, but he also lost his life and his lover, who couldn't suffer his scarred body.Now Lucas has a new life in a little small town where everyone loves him, above all the local sheriff; Nicholas is an handsome man, with plenty of choice if he wants, but he sets his eyes on Lucas. When they met five years before, Lucas was still too traumatized by his past events and he was not ready for something serious, and so Nicholas accepted the second choice to be his best friend. But now Riley is out of prison and both Lucas than Nicholas know that the man will come for Lucas, and Nicholas is not willing to let the man take the most important thing he has, Lucas; since Nicholas has no doubt that Lucas is his own.The story is not very long and there is not mystery, since it's clear since the beginning that Riley will try to harm Lucas once again. It's more interesting to read and see how Nicholas will convince Lucas to accept not only his help but also his love. Truth be told, I think that Nicholas takes advantage of the situation to force Lucas to accept something than in other condition it will be years before they arrive to the same point. Probably Nicholas is tired to wait (but not enough to renounce) and above all he is tired to be judge by someone else actions. And this is maybe the point that I understood less: it's true that Lucas is scarred, but only on his back; in his everyday life, with dress on, he is a very beautiful man, and no one can notice his scars. All right, being a gay man, maybe having is back all scarred is a bit more important than a straight man (naughty Elisa, I know), but is it enough of a reason to dump someone? Lucas is clever, handsome, with a good work, is it possible that someone dumped him for some scars? And even if it happened, is it possible that he chose 10 years of chastity upon the action of only one man?Anyway, the story is quite tender and the sex is good, something I noticed in the previous books by the same author: she mixes well the two elements, never letting the sex take the main role in the story, always letting the tenderness and love being in first line.",positive,book
11531,"As I stated on my Kindle, This book is an excellent read. Interesting to note that it takes place right after the First World War. The Author indicates there appears to be an open door towards another war. However, this other war is the war of ideology. It would be very much like the Cold War we experienced between the Free World and the Marxist World. Along with that, there is a fair amount of fiction as Bulldog Drummond and his many relationships are all fictional. In any event, the Author has the unique ability to blend the two together. As stated previously, this book is an excellent read. Thank you.",positive,book
11068,"Despite her pronounced limp, Professor Briony Swift is extremely good at her job so she's stunned when two of her A students hand her drop class requests.  She can't deny that seeing Nic and Leo in class every day has been a pleasure.  They're certainly the stars of many of her more erotic fantasies but they're students and therefore off limits.Nic Potter and Leo Phelps only enrolled in Briony's class so that they could get closer to her.  Neither of them needs the credit for her class in order to graduate and they feel it's time to make their true intentions toward Briony known.  They've seen her watching them and are aware that her desire for them is as strong as theirs is for her but there are ethics involved and convincing her to give them a chance is going to be more complicated than they initially thought.Nic and Leo's feelings for Briony go beyond sexual desire.  They honestly want to build a future with her.  However, their initial approach and suggestion that they have dinner together doesn't go over so well - especially once Nic blurts out the full extent of their sexual plans for her.  Briony's intelligent enough to know that the classroom is her safe haven and any non-academic involvement with Nic and Leo will be frowned upon.  That doesn't stop her from fanaticizing about them though.  Be that as it may, it's only a matter of time before she caves in to her own desires and takes Nic and Leo to her bed.  Just when it looks like they could possibly have a future together disaster strikes and their secret rendezvous are discovered.  Faced with the choice of career or her men Briony has some heavy decisions to make.Brynn Paulin's TWO PLUS ONE dives headfirst into the quandary of ethics versus desire.  Briony's a wonderful teacher who has always toed the line when it comes to her career.  Nic and Leo initially appear to be nothing more than college students hell bent on bedding the teacher but as you'll discover there's much more to them than meets the eye.  What I love about this story is watching Briony grow from a jittery unsure woman to one who stands up for herself and what she believes to be right.  Her disability and her career has been a crutch for her for so long that she's lost sight of what could truly make her happy so it brought a smile to my face to imagine Nic and Leo's determination to make her see herself the way they see her.  TWO PLUS ONE is one hot story full of steamy sex, raw sensuality and lots of little surprises as this trio works toward finding a way to build a future together.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",positive,book

896,"Fairy tales are usually thought of as children's literature, and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit. However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and there are many other folk tales that are not as familiar as these and yet are equally beautiful and imaginative.This collection of the English fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain English cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and unusual magical objects are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place ""once upon a time."" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary. The dialogues, however, are replete with colloquial English expressions and turns of phrase, and these characteristics give the fairy tales a very folksy feel. This collection will be a great source of enjoyment for children and adults alike.",positive,book

Reading about knights and castles are always enjoyable novels for me. Bottom line...Woman of Honor is a well-told, emotionally gripping story. I was literally swept away into the battle scenes, the romance, the fierce loyalty and honor even if it went against matters of the heart. I nearly cried several times while reading this story and was so engrossed a bomb could have gone off outside and I would've kept reading. I am eagerly anticipating the next book in the series. And anyone who has a computer can read this book. While it may not be a print book yet and can only be read in e-book format, it's well worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. My heart is still pounding. And don't let that sweet rating fool you. There was some serious passion in this novel, but if you were to compare it to most romances I guess it was sweet since the characters honored each other's purity. But it still sizzled.

6141,"This book could easily carry another subtitle: How to Train Your Brain! According to the author there's a simple way to do that: Mind Mapping.If someone ever told me that there was a way for me to start reading faster than I already do, I'd say that he was crazy. And if I'd never read this book I'd insist he was. However in the book at hand I've discovered a simple example, which I'll call for the purposes of this review 'Reading by the Dot,' that left me speechless. Thanks to it I did not only read a paragraph in great speed, but I've also memorized almost every word of it.It is widely known that every person uses only a limited amount of his mind's capabilities. This book offers the reader a chance to enhance his reading and learning experiences, and improve his memory as well.As we read in the introduction: ""A Mind Map is a diagram you create to organize your thoughts. In conventional note-taking, you write information down line by line or perhaps column by column. Mind Mapping differs from such note-taking in that you present the information more in the form of a diagram.""And how does that help me? one would ask. Well, for starters, I'd answer, it helps with your memory since it is easier to remember images than words. Visualization is the key word here. Kids, just as much as the adults, do not have many difficulties in remembering images but when it comes to words it's a different story.One of the examples that the author uses to prove his point is the diagrams he uses to create an overview of the popular novel To Kill a Mockingbird. Through these diagrams we follow the book from point one all the way to the end, taking a good look at the characters and their interactions, and thus get a brief yet detailed view of the story. ""One idea is interconnected with many other ideas,"" we read, and, as we well know, one person is interconnected with many other persons, which helps prove the point.Mind Mapping has many advantages; it balances the brain, simplifies life, helps with creativity, and speeds up the learning processes. It also has some disadvantages though since it asks of you to change your habits, to spend time to get to know how it works, and maybe creates some minor problems when it comes to speaking since language is an auditory process. The former though overrule the latter, since learning how to operate with Mind Maps can help you change your life for the better in many ways.""...essentially, there's no limit to how vast your Mind Map can become. A subtopic in the first Mind Map you create may become the central idea in the next one you draw. Each subtopic in a map is in effect a center of another map. This is the beauty of the technique--relationships may go on as extensively as they exist in your mind."" Now, how interesting is that!To be honest before reading this book I knew next to nothing about how Mind Mapping works. I've read things about it here and there, but I'd never thought to give it a try. Well, all that has changed. I now find this subject as intriguing as they come. As someone who reads dozens of books every year, and always wishes to read even more, I believe that adopting the technique of Mind Mapping will help me achieve my goals. I think that if I should come to master it the results could be, if nothing else, highly satisfying.Mind Mapping can help one in many walks of life: from organizing vacations to creating business plans, from generating presentations to solving everyday problems, and the list goes on and on.A lot of people say that everything is in our head; the book at hand proves them right. And then it highlights the way one has to follow to reach his own high point, to widen his horizons.If you'd ask me to put this book in a category I wouldn't know which one to choose. Is it a self-help manual? In a way it is, but it's much more than that. To use a metaphor I'd say that this is a guide of how to use the GPS of your brain to find the destinations you desperately seek, and need.",positive,book

Marc and Blake have been fighting demons but Blake seems to not see it as a responsibility but more as fun.  Marc is frustrated that Blake can't see that to protect the humans IS what's important, that humans are important.  When they meet Kate and her fellow human fighters while fighting a group of demons, they are taken back by Kate to the human compound, where they are greeted with not quite friendly faces.  Marc is intrigued by Kate, her boldness, her strength and by her beauty.  He knows it's not safe to get involved with a human and sees Blake's growing attraction to Kate as a threat to their very well being.  Kate is also torn by her attraction to both Marc and Blake.  She's distracted by them in the field which could prove deadly but she also knows they need Marc and Blake's help in fighting the demons.  Blake has some personal ""demons"" of his own to confront and deal with in his life as does Marc.  Secrets that both have that make their relationship difficult.

I liked this author so much, I got the rest of her Heat stories, and liked them all. This is a Sci-Fi Erotica story, it doesn't say when or where it is set. But it feels like an alternate universe in the future. It is between Aidan and War, our two main characters, Aidan is a pilot and War is called an Enforcer (basically a hired goon). The story kept me captivated, it had a believable romance between the two main characters, unlike other Erotic novels, they didn't go at it from page one. The Steamy scenes didn't come about until around Chapter Five. Her Heat series aren't the longest books, to me at least, but they did have substance, it was a full story with bits of erotica thrown in the appropriate parts, it kept me interested and captivated until the end.",positive,book

She's not looking for a lifelong love or even a long term relationship but she'd love to find a master who can bring out the full extent of her passion.Even after all this time Jane is still hurt by Peter's betrayal and knows trusting anyone with her heart or body will not be easy.  Her best friend and business partner Lily accompanies her to a bondage-themed event that their business R.S.V.P. is responsible for setting up.  It's more than just networking for Jane though, it's her first foray back into the BDSM scene and she just hopes to find one man who appeals to her.Once they arrive at the party location, Lily and Jean Jacques settle into their non-interested attitudes despite the fact that the sexual tension between them is practically off the charts.  Jane's just waiting for Jean Jacques to toss Lily over his shoulder and show her just what she's missing.  Jane spends the evening hunting for a potential master for the night but no one's sparked an interest.  What she doesn't realize is that Antonio Villareal spotted her the moment she entered the ballroom and he has every intention of getting to know her - in every way possible.Antonio isn't having the best of luck when it comes to women.  Sure, he's rich, gorgeous and single but women are only after him because of what they'd gain by being seen on his arm.  He's looking for a submissive woman to share his life and has set his sights on Jane.  The only problem is she's told him upfront she isn't looking for a happily-ever-after.  Some really hot sex in the here and now will do wonders for her but anything further is more than she's willing to consider.  Will Antonio be able to convince her that she can have all the smoldering sex she could ever want if she'd just give him a chance?Dominique Adair's storylines are ones that I'm consistently drawn to over and over.  Her plots and characters never fail to draw the reader into the storyline while promising to seduce you with each heat filled scene.  In SEDUCING JANE PORTER we're introduced to Jane, a character who's love and trust was horribly abused yet she's brave enough to attempt another foray into the BDSM world.  Antonio is exactly the sort of master Jane desires - even if she isn't aware of it yet.

They decide to go with Calypso Productions, but the meeting is a disaster.  In the end, Luke asks one of the women to meet again somewhere else, hoping he can convince her to help in a less formal setting.  The woman, Lena, asks him to dinner.  Though he's nervous--and attracted to Lena--Luke agrees.Lena has risen to a position of influence as a founding member of Calypso Productions.  Together with her three friends, she's one of Hollywood's young elite.  Normally she would blow off a guy who gives a presentation as awkwardly as Luke and his friends did.  Since she finds him attractive, however, she asks him to dinner with the intention of seducing him.  Will Lena still want Luke when she discovers what he and his friends are?Lights, Camera...Monsters is a cute and interesting tale of what happens when an up-and-coming Hollywood businesswoman meets a monster, literally.  Lena is secure in her own place in the world, and proud of her accomplishments.  She's tough and knows what she wants.  Luke, with his mixture of toughness and tenderness, confidence and vulnerability, throws her for a loop.  The scene in which she first sees Luke's true form is really funny.  I liked Luke's navet&eacute; regarding human customs, and his uncertainty.  He softened some of Lena's grating edges.  The storyline itself is engaging, with lots of sex, some action and suspense, and a rather unusual take on the paranormal/monster genre.  Secondary characters, including Luke's friends and Lena's business partners, are clearly destined for their own stories.  If you like the paranormal but are getting tired of the same old creatures, Lights, Camera...Monsters is a good choice.CassieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",positive,book

9357,"London - 1867Dylan Blake has spent twelve long years in dedicated service to the Crown.  He's sold his commission with the hopes that his father would allow him to take over one of the many Blake estates.  His father refused and Dylan's attempts at finding comparable employment on his own are proving unfruitful.  He may be the son of an earl but his situation is getting dire.  His has very little funds, is on the verge of being evicted from the boarding house where he's staying and his father's hatred for him is blatantly obvious.Because of her large dowry, Lady Natalia Sinclair is a highly sought after young woman.  She has no illusions about her many would-be suitors - they're all far more interested in her monetary value then her.  Besides, she's perfectly aware that her father will select her future husband and therefore the endless parties and courtship techniques are pointless.  There's only one man who appeals to her, Captain Dylan Blake, but he's a second son and doesn't possess a title.Dylan takes great pride in infuriating his father and what better way to accomplish that then to arrive late for his father's all-important annual ball.  Receiving one of the prized invitations is considered a social accomplishment - there are only one hundred guests to his shindig and Dylan throws off the whole thing by arriving late.  While most of the guests are horrified at Dylan's audacity, Natalia is intrigued.  She's read newspaper articles lauding his military accomplishments and would love for a man like him to court her.Dylan escapes from the stuffiness of the ballroom along with his friend Lord Basingstake.  Once there, Dylan is confronted by Lord Jonathan who makes a wager regarding Dylan's ability to charm a woman of Jonathan's choosing.  The woman chosen is Natalia and all Dylan has to do is get her to agree to a second dance - something which no man has thus far been able to accomplish.  The wager is for one hundred pounds.While he's never had any trouble charming any woman, Dylan will soon discover that Natalia is unlike any other woman and she sees right through his good looks and bluster and sees the empty shell of a man he's become.  There's no emotion behind his request for a dance and because of that simple fact she turns him down.  Dylan's life is about to change in a major way - all because of a good woman who's too smart to accept any less than all of him.  Throw in a few well-hidden family secrets and Dylan may just find the one thing he's always wanted - someone to love him unconditionally.Diana Bold captivated me with THE AMERICAN HEIRESS and I really wanted to know more about Dylan and Natalia's story.  Dylan's need for love and acceptance really pulls at the heartstrings and makes you wonder why his father hates him so much.  Natalia is impossible not to like - she's smart, beautiful and not at all pretentious.  I loved the emotional turmoil both characters experience throughout this storyline and especially enjoyed how Dylan learns about the family secrets his father tried so hard to keep hidden from him.  This is a wonderful tale and I highly recommend both THE WAGER and THE AMERICAN HEIRESS - trust me, you'll want to read all about Dylan's brother Michael's trials and tribulations with a very improper American woman.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",positive,book

What I will tell you is that I absolutely LOVED this book. It's rare to find an author who can write as poignantly as Megan Hart, what's even rarer is finding an author who can write short stories that are just as deep, touching, and moving. This story was more than I imagined it to be. I thought, ""A short story about Elle and Dan! Yay!"" I read the blurb and expected Elle to be at war with her feelings regarding a baby (which she was). What I didn't expect was so much to be packed into so few words. It was about Elle but we also got to see so many other people in her life and what they mean to her and how they help her form her decision as to whether or not she's ready to have a baby. In the end, the decision she makes comes from her heart. I love how well Dan fits her. He just lets her make her own decisions. He may plant the seed of thought there, but he doesn't push. THAT is what makes them perfect together.I love follow-up stories like this. Thank goodness for Spice Briefs because otherwise we may not have had another chance to visit with Dan and Elle. I can't help but wonder if Ms. Hart will, at some time in the future, let us drop in on Elle and Dan and see what's new in their lives once again. I know they've got their happily-ever-after and that alone can sustain me, but I like Elle and her complexity. She's real. Megan Hart has quickly become on of my favorite authors.",positive,book

8580,"I have to say Jessica Coulter Smith is doing something right when it comes to shifters and the like. If you have not already done so I suggest you read the prequel of the series called Whispering Lake. These first two books can be read as standalones though. I was hoping to see Cole's story, knowing that he kind of got left holding the bag in the prequel. So a quick recap, Cole is out and about in his wolf form when he stumbles upon Marin an injured battered woman. He calls for help from Cassie (Whispering Lake). Turns out Marin is a mate to one of the super hot brothers (in age order Gabriel, Cole, and Michael; the latter two are twins with different color eyes). Turns out Marin has been abused but is strangely comforted by Cole who adorably stays in wolf form to make her feel more comfortable.This book was given to me for an honest review.First, I want to say that I really appreciated the blending of the prequel with Moonlight Protector it was flawless. Second, the title is aptly named. Cole the lead male in this story is the protector in both human and wolf form. Cole purposely keeps to his wolf form for the comfort of the lead female character Marin who has been kidnapped and abused. Third, the humorous element to this story helps cut the serious nature of the topic. I really felt that the comic relief was pulled off nicely. My favorite scene is when the dirt bag who kidnapped her appears at the family's Victorian home asking for Marin; Cole and Marin come out of his room all over each other pretending that they have been up to no good, while Michael the constant jokester plays with the whole charade in order to protect Marin (the scene is a lot funnier than my lame attempt and summarization).I really enjoyed the twist that if you are a mate then your packs blood can heal you, I found this fascinating from an anthropology standpoint. I wondered if evolution specifically selected for something like that (just an errant thought). There was a great blend of drama, romance, paranormal, and mystery. Once again Mrs. Coulter Smith has transported me into Ashton Grove, Georgia and made me lose track of time. I was so absorbed in the story I missed Lunch! And I love lunch LOL.I recommend adding this book to your reading list and you will not be disappointed.Book Summary:Cole Andrews, biologist by trade and werewolf by blood, is tired of being alone. He and his two brothers live in the large Victorian home that had belonged to their parents. He's always wanted to find his mate and start a family. Now that he's in his thirties, he's starting to give up hope. He's already seen all of the women available in his small town of Ashton Grove and so far none of them are ""the one.""Marin Thomas is fleeing for her life. After being abducted and held hostage, she is determined to escape the maniac once and for all. Stealing his car, she travels as far and as fast as she can - until a car accident lands her in some woods near Ashton Grove, Georgia.

Riding West is well put together and you can imagine just how long Parker put up with Celia until he was pushed just a little too far.  It was fun to see how the characters interacted and how each reacted to the other.  Add to the fact that Ms. Wildes can surely write an erotic love scene and you get a quick spicy read with Riding West.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",positive,book

My only complaint is I wish it was longer, but Treanor does manage to make me care about Anna and Joe. I don't have a problem with an assassin hero in this, and even better Joe never turns into a typical domesticated reformed man--he keeps his edge of danger.I thought I'd be squicked because, hey, she lusts after a crash test dummy .... but the heat works really well.After I read it, Marie Treanor went on my autobuy list and she hasn't disappointed me yet.",positive,book

4523,"If what you want is fair reporting, full reporting and the news from a totally objective point of view, you won't ever go wrong with The Economist. It is, and always has been, THE most credible, most respected, most prized news and financial magazine. And, being a British publication, it is well-written and smart. It is also well organized.To be sure, the magazine is opinionated and expresses that opinion. This is perhaps not a good thing. For example, in a recent article we read, ""America has proposed limiting these imbalance to 4% of GDP. That is too rigid, but there is plenty of scope for the G20 to agree on the ranges countries' current-account balances should reach.""This is from the ""Leaders"" section, not opinion or editorial. So the reader needs to determine if he believes the writer or not.Now, about the Kindle price. It's way too high and I wouldn't pay it. I subscribe to the online edition of The Economist and I use free software to put it on my Kindle. In fact, I do that with all my newspapers and magazines. I would never pay what Amazon charges.I read yesterday that Kindle is starting to offer publishers a deal: the publisher gets 70 percent and Amazon keeps thirty. That should mean more digital content for your Kindle at a lower cost. I hope so. But until then, don't pay this price for The Economist. Otherwise, I highly recommend it.-- Susanna K.

9663,"Stacy Daniels's father has been dead to her for years but now that he's finally passed away in reality she has some very difficult decisions to make.  She's been living and working in Great Falls but her father's ranch is where her heart truly lies.  There's just the little issue of her love for Wolfe, Cash and Travis and how wrong loving them seems.Brothers Wolfe, Cash and Travis have been in love with Stacy for years.  They've done their best to protect her from her father's bullying and hateful attitude.  They've never expressed their feelings to Stacy and now with her father gone they feel it's time for her to come back to the ranch - where she belongs - as their woman.Stacy's guilt over the perceived wrong on being in love with three men is emotionally agonizing.  She's convinced her only option is to sell the beloved ranch and return to Great Falls as soon as possible.  Only first she has to consult the attorney about the property and for some reason the man is never available.  That means she spends a lot of time around the ranch and avoiding Wolfe, Cash and Travis is impossible especially when each of them keeps such a close eye on her.  When each man individually seduces her she becomes even more confused and scared.  Despite the men's insistence that she is home, she's determined to leave and doesn't believe there's any way she can confide in them about her feelings for them all.  As it is she's afraid they're going to find out that's she's cheated on each of them with their own brother.  Only there are things that Stacy doesn't know which will shock and change everything she's ever believed.  Will she stay after learning the truth about the ranch and what her father did?HER DAKOTA MEN takes readers on an emotional journey along with the characters as each comes to grips with their feelings and what they mean for their future.

I love books about hot alpha males and strong women that know what they want.  Some readers may find it predictable, but not me.  I could read and let the story unfold.  I have enjoyed all the books I've read from this author and I look forward to upcoming additions.  This is the 2nd book after Lords of the Were, so there are characters from the last book here.  It's not necessary to read the previous book but if you do it makes it more fun.  I like reading series just for that reason.  Here we find out more about the vampire world where in the last book the focus was on the Were creatures.  Also there is more of a certain fey knight that makes one wonder about upcoming developments.Be aware that the sex is liberal and a major part of this world culture, which I like.

Broke and in need of a place to stay, Thom sets off to find a temporary job.  He ends up finding a job bartending at The Happy Onion, a vegan restaurant.  He celebrates by going out to a club, intending to get laid.Philip Sorrells is bored with the scene at his favorite hangout, at least until a hot young man walks in the door.  He's more than glad to pick the guy up, and the night and morning that follow are incredible.  Things get weird, however, when he learns his one-night stand is working at his restaurant.  Phil wants to pursue a relationship with Thom, but Thom's reluctant to have any sort of relationship with a boss.  Other issues intrude as well.  Can these two very different men figure out a way to be together?The Happy Onion has a little something for everyone.  There's humor, emotion, hot sex, and even some suspense.  The characters are all very likeable, especially the hot-tempered, young-looking Thom and Phil, whose delight in annoying Thom just to get a reaction made me snicker.  The conflicts between Thom and Phil struck me as realistic, especially given how different the two men were and how Phil felt about Thom's future employers.  Of course, the love scenes between them are hot and sometimes emotional as well.  While The Happy Onion won't be replacing Eight Arms to Hold You or Willow Bend as my favorite Ally Blue book, it was certainly an enjoyable read.  If you're a fan of Ms. Blue or just gay romance in general, you're sure to enjoy The Happy Onion just as I did.Cassiereviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",positive,book

4391,"First off for the spell checkers out there. When I read I read the story and not the words and especially not the individual letters. The purpose of writing a story is too take your reader on a trip. I thought Mr. Morris did a great job of telling me a story. When you tell a story you OFTEN don't use the perfect verbiage that you might use in your doctoral dissertation. That is because it is a story and SHOULD be told in the voice of the people in the story. I also am a writer AND I live in the South. I often use words like y'all and ain't in my stories. I'm sorry if it is offensive but that is the way the people in my stories often talk. A person from Boston or whatever might even say &#34;you'se guys&#34;.The story is about TEENAGERS! Post pubescent kids have sex drives and that is just the way it is. THAT is reality. I thought he handled it both realistically and with good taste. Actually I think if he had gone for a more realistic handling of this it would have included a LOT more sexual tension and activity.Some people don't think that it is realistic that kids this age COULD deal with things like this as well as these kids did. Let me tell you, My Dad graduated high-school when he was 15. WW2 was in high gear and he couldn't enlist because he was too young. He went to Dallas and worked in an aircraft factory for a year and then enlisted in the Navy the day after his 16th birthday. His Grandfather was in the trenches in France when he was that age. One ancestor fought at Shiloh in the Civil War when he was 14! Another died at the battle of San Jacento when Texas defeated the Mexicans and earned our freedom. He was 17! Just because we don't ask a lot of kids these days does NOT mean that they can't do amazing things.Sex...Dale Evans, Roy Rogers wife got married the first time when she was 12. Laura Engels Wilder (Little House on the prairie) eloped and married at 12 also. A lot of &#34;kids&#34; in the past were &#34;adults&#34; at a very young age. I have no doubt that if today&#8217;s kids were tossed in the fire they would adapt, grow up and deal.The story was engaging and well worth reading. The characters were interesting and attractive.

That's why she's heading back to her hometown in rural Idaho to confront her memories and feelings once and for all.Nice guy Kyle Watson and dark and brooding Alan Caine have known Cassie since she was just a little girl.  They'd been inseparable and as they grew up their feelings inevitably changed to a deep-seated desire which none of them addressed.Eventually Kyle and Alan's feelings result in a sexual frustration that needs to be assuaged so they turn to each other.  Unfortunately Cassie witnesses their encounter and jumps to the conclusion that they've chosen each other over her.  It's been three years since she last saw either of the men and she learns they now live and run a ranch together.  Kyle and Alan aren't stupid, they realize that Cassie would never choose one of them over the other so they'd agreed to share her - that had been before she'd run away.  Now that she's back it's up to them to convince Cassie that they love her and a relationship between the three of them could work.Sierra Dafoe has definitely won over many readers with her warmhearted, tender storylines.  Cassie, Kyle and Alan's unique relationship fascinated me because the men waited so long for Cassie to return to them.  Their love for her is obvious in everything they do.

She was supposed to be in Afghanistan to counsel soldiers; but, instead she was standing before a very handsome stranger who introduced himself as Shahryar with the request for her to tell him a story each night for the next one thousand and one nights.  What came as an even more of a shocker to Rolanda was that he knew her erotic romance writing pen name.Biding her time while planning her escape, Rolanda composed her first night's fiction entitled Positively Despotic...In the land of Frumos - where two brothers were bounded by magic, by birth and the love of one woman - as long as the triad was whole, the land would be peaceful and prosperous; however if it was to be broken only destruction and hostility would exist.  For a century, that bond had been broken by treachery and black magic - now the time had come for the current ruling brothers to find and unite with their special woman to restore tranquility and harmony throughout land of Frumos.The Alexandrescu's brothers Valentin and Dragos were perceived by the outside world to brutally take whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted.  Well, international reporter Kiana Davis was determined to discover if all the negative rumors surrounding the Alexandrescu brothers were true.  Kiana gained more than she bargained for when she discovered nothing was quite as it seemed.  What came as even more of a surprise was her strong attraction to both Valentin and Dragos and the brothers' insistence that she was the one to complete their triad.Author Shara Azod has managed to roll two fantastic stories into one with Positively Despotic.  The first couple, Rolanda and Shahryar, will remain a secondary focal point for the entire series of 1,001 Nights with Shara.  I was greatly intrigued by this couple.  Ms. Azod successful carved Shahryar into a great, sexy mystery that I am eager to discover more about.  Rolanda will definitely have to stay on her toes with him because I have a feeling that very soon she will be the star in Shahryar's bedroom scene long before her 1,001 nights' freedom come knocking at the door.However, the main plot revolved around a threesome couple.  Instant sparks flew and the flames burning hotly until the very end.  Even though the storyline took place over a couple of days, Ms. Azod still managed to craft a plausible, spell-bounding tale with incredible characters.  Valentin and Dragos were dominate, sexy and very charming alphas, while Kiana proved to be a strong, intelligent heroine.  Their sexcapades, whether as a twosome or threesome, were passionately erotic and frequent in nature.  All in all, Positively Despotic was fabulous read that I am sure many will enjoy.NikitaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",positive,book

She never stays in one town more than one month, remaining as unattached as possible so that leaving is easier to bear.  But when she takes a job at Turner Industries, staying isolated proves impossible as she finds herself irresistibly drawn to her employer, Kyle Turner III.  Still, she avoids becoming involved with him past their working relationship - that is, until her clairvoyant abilities show her a fatal vision involving Kyle!Kyle knows all about Aislinn's past, in minute detail.  Being ex-Special Forces and in the security industry, it is his business to know everything about the people close to him - especially pretty little personal assistants who distract him like no other woman can.  He has no intention of letting Aislinn run again, not when he can protect her from her past and keep her close to him, where she belongs...I do not think Annmarie McKenna can do wrong with a story.  I have loved every piece of her work I have read so far!  Two Sighted was a pleasure both to read and to write a review for.  It is books like this that make my job simple, and I wish they could all be this good.Kyle Turner III pushed every button I have, proving that this author knows just what women love in their heroes.  In fact, if you could place orders for men that would exactly suit your needs, I would want McKenna's help placing the order since she seems to know what I want better than I do myself!  Kyle is the epitome of the overprotective Alpha male who pursues the woman he loves with an unwavering focus and a sensitivity that belies his `he-man' status.Aislinn's fear and loneliness are palpable as she longs for those simple human comforts long denied her - a best friend, a phone call with her mother, a man to fall in love with, a home that is hers for longer than 8 months.  Yet even in her determination to remain detached, we see that she can't help but care about those around her.  While her abusive ex-husband may have stolen her sense of belonging, her hopes for a future, he hasn't robbed her of her empathy.  While it might be easy to be jealous of the woman who captures the attentions of the hunky Kyle, no one could begrudge Aislinn for stealing his heart.I was impressed with Annmarie McKenna's very first novel,Blackmailed, and my admiration for her work grows with each new release.  In Two Sighted, she effortlessly sets the stage for a sequel starring several of the supporting leaving her fans aching for it without leaving this book feeling unfinished in any way.

This books stand alone but I highly recommend that you read the first book in the series: The Were Lords""  Which focuses on my second favorite sub Werewolves and those 2 Alpha twins will cause more than just your heart to flutter.  lolAh! Dante!! ""Dominantly Masculine; ""Undeniably Sexy""  ""A Force to be reckoned With;""  ""Dips and Valleys of Masculine Perfection."" Dante gets my (not so Famous) 5 SWOON SALUTE!  As sexy as the cover is I don't think it does Dante justice.  I like Megan's character, in fact, she is the perfect heroine and Duncan was beyond delicious. There are none of the angsts, misunderstanding or stupid choices that so many romance novels are filled with.This is a must read for adults who love the paranormal, suspense, action and romance.  There is a good plot and the story is filled with twist and turns that are quite unique.  HOWEVER, be forewarned this novel is not for adults who shy away from Hot, Steamy, Scintillating sex scenes.  Personally I wouldn't change a thing!  So what are you waiting for buy it already! :-)**SPOILER ALERT*** This book ended on such a malevolent note that my spine rippled with chills of anticipation for the next installment!",positive,book
8195,"The sad thing is that so many have forgotten the works of H Beam Piper. Along with Robert A Heinlein and Isaac Asimov, Piper wrote within a consistent future history. His works are intriguing and a good lesson in history, with depth and references to keep serious readers involved. It's a real pity the cycle was never completed, as the gaps left his histories a little fuzzy (in joke for HBP fans). Reading his works emphasises what a tragedy that the world lost such a talent so early, as this is quality story writing. Enjoy",positive,book

10805,"I loved this title!  It's fun, sexy, very entertaining.The heroine is feisty, not falling all over the Hero, her own person.  She's not mooning over oh lover where art thou?  I like a no (or not too much) nonsense heroine that doesn't pout, cry over nothing, cringe, and otherwise wimp out.  She can give a punch and take a punch after all this is an adventure.  A tough cookie who doesn't mind enjoying one hot hunky guy without agonizing over it.The Hero is long suffering and on the heroine's side.  There are lots of bad guys and lots of double crossing.  It's just a good light read.  I did not think there was too much sex, it was appropriate to the story and relationship.  I happen to like space romances and this is a good one.I will read more of this writer.",positive,book

6927,"Ok, so this book is relatively short, coming in around 9200 words, under 40 pages.  Right off the bat it starts with a sexy shower scene - my favorite!  I don't know what it is, but the water, the steam, the whole thing just sets me off.  Here we meet Brett and Lisa, human and vampire, respectively.  And as it turns out, they are in a relationship, eleven months so far.I felt like they were really great together.  They had a playfulness, and you could still see they cared for each other beyond that flirtation.  They respected each other for what they were, and so when Lisa went to the club downstairs to feed, Brett (and I) thought nothing of it.But here I'm going to break off from the characters for a minute to talk about On The Edge, the club.  This place is very much a character in the story, itself.  It's vampire and human friendly, a place for them to meet and mingle, and sometimes even more.  Drink blood, or ""dirty wine"", or anything else a mere mortal might enjoy.  It's a place with alcoves and overhead walkways, loud music, and great ambiance.In the club, Lisa runs into an old friend - Leo.  Right away their familiarity puts me on edge a bit.  Um, hello, what about Brett??  So when Lisa brings both of them back to the home that Brett and Lisa share, I can definitely understand - and agree with - Brett's apprehension.But that Lisa, she's a smarty.  And there comes a point in this story when I got very angry with her, I felt betrayed for Brett, and in a very bad way.  I called Lisa some very bad names.  But like I said, she's smart.  Don't underestimate that girl, and don't think her heart is in the wrong place.And Leo?  He turned out to be one of my favorites of the five I met through these two books.  I absolutely adore this man, and his lack of inhibitions. He's tall, dark, and handsome.  Sexy and mysterious.  Dangerous.  All of the above, and all things vampire.This story was m-m-f and m-f-m.  And it was so wonderful and beautiful, and unbearably hot.  I definitely recommend it, and I definitely recommend reading it first, before moving on any more in the On The Edge series.",positive,book

10812,"As a mystery/thriller fan, it was a great treat to see Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine offered on the Kindle.  My Kindle edition of the initial issue offered included 9 short stories, including a great Lawrence Block ""Keller"" story and a new English translation of a wonderful Japanese mystery set in the world of the Japanese police. There was also a short review column on mystery blogs and a meaty, interesting book review column.  The issue was rounded out by a nice reproduction of the print edition's cover, two cute poems (crime-oriented, of course), and announcement of the magazine's 2007 Reader Awards.At the end of each story, one is given the option to jump back to the table of contents to select another story, but I chose to just sail right through and read the whole edition ""cover to cover"".  That's something I never did with the print edition for some reason.  I guess just seeing one nicely presented page at a time on the Kindle versus seeing one big intimidating digest all at once makes all the difference for us readers who battle an occasional lazy streak.I'll likely check out one or two other Dell magazines offered on the Kindle.  It was a nice diversion from the regular reading of my Kindle novel and news blogs to enjoy a piece of short fiction every day or so (I made this first issue last about two weeks).  But, whatever other Dell titles I end up trying out, Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine is likely to be the one ongoing, regular visitor to my Kindle each month.Note: Amazon frequently updates the presentation the functionality of Kindle blogs and periodicals, so as this review gets older, it may no longer accurately describe the current version of this product.",positive,book

And yes, there were some spoilers, but I still loved it. Father Mine is what happens after Happily Ever After, the story that happens between the ""end"" of Lover Awakened and the epilogue that takes place sixteen months later.I knew that Zsasdist had overcome his past enough to be with Bella, but I was very curious as to how that would play out in his daily life, and with a family. Father Mine was dark. It went more into his past as a Blood Slave, how he's still haunted by it, and his fears as to how it will play a part in the future. And even though this is about vampires, the family and marriage aspect of the story is one that is very relatable.Father Mine was absolutely brilliant.

The reader manages to sympathize with the hero even though what he did to the heroine as a young man was selfish.  You understand that they are products of their society.  The manner that both come to understand each other and fall in love just fits.The fact that the authors did not try to make an easy & pat resolution for the couple speaks well of their talent for weaving a realistic and satisfying story.

2996,"For Christina Marshall growing up with an abusive drunk of a father is sufficient reason to not want a man in her life.  That doesn't stop her from being extremely attracted to two of her bosses, Jon and JT.  She's heard the rumors about them sharing women and is trying very hard to convince herself that she isn't interested in the two of them - together.Jon and JT have no qualms about their lifestyle or the fact that they want to make Christina a part of it.  The problem is that she's so skittish that getting close to her has been impossible - until now.  They've enlisted the aid of her friend Aislinn to help make Christina more comfortable with them.Aislinn is aware of Christina's aversion to men and alcohol but she also knows Jon and JT well enough to know that neither man would hurt her and judging by Christina's relaxed demeanor when the men are around she knows it too.  Since Christina isn't about to trust any man enough to start a romantic relationship, Aislinn suggests she indulge in a fling - just to get them out of her system.Christina follows her instincts and allows herself to be seduced into Jon and JT's bed for a sexual encounter she'll never forget.  Hours later she's awaken by the ringing of her cell phone only to receive the devastating news that her mother has died.  Christina's positive her father's abuse is what killed her mother.  Neither man will allow her to contend with her family alone.  Christina is going to have to come to grips with her feelings for them and learn to trust them - with her heart and her well-being.  She just may learn that there are some men who are not a complete waste of skin!Annmarie McKenna's THE STRENGTH OF THREE is more than a smoldering romance, it's a glimpse into the lives of children brought up in abusive homes as adults.  I really have to admire Christina for not only having the strength to stand up to her father and brother but for being brave enough to give Jon and JT a chance.  She's obviously afraid of history repeating itself but figures a fling with Jon and JT is safe enough.  Jon and JT are wonderfully alpha male and so intent on winning Christina's trust that it makes you smile just reading about them.  As for Christina's father and brother, well you'll love to hate them and the situation that led to Christina's mother's death.  Plus I have to tell you I got a real kick out of JT and Jon kidnapping Christina's guard dog to bring it to their home so she'd feel safer with them.  I can just see this huge dog going for these ex-military's gonads, too funny.If you're curious about Aislinn's story and haven't done so yet, be sure to pick up a copy of TWO SIGHTED.  I missed that one but I'm curious enough that I've added it next on my TBR pile.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",positive,book

9745,"I've enjoyed all of Ava March's books, including this one.  Hopefully, it will become available in print before much longer.  Her books specialize in Regency period England, M/M erotic romances.  And they are all filled with scorching hot erotic scenes between well drawn, flawed yet generally sympathetic characters who one hopes will find a way to a permanent loving relationship.  The fact that this (as do all her books) takes place in an era when anal sex could get guys hanged (literally) for sodomy added an extra challenge to a plot involving two men seeking more than just companionship.Her books all involve some strong tension / conflict between the protagonists, and this one is no exception.  Arsen is rich, powerful, sexually adept, socially prominent yet a ""bad boy"" and ""known"" womanizer, but he is not satisfied with any of his previous mistresses and not in search of a virginal young woman / debutante to marry.  Harry is a big, gorgeous, raw-boned hunk, with only minimal sexual experience, who has the ""misfortune"" to have fallen head over heels in love with straight, womanizer Arsen, usually a recipe for disaster if ever there was one.  So the two have some dancing around each other to do before either reveals his true feelings, then those initial revelations are incomplete, leading to some misconceptions and wrong ""conclusions.""  Not necessarily the most creative plotline, but lots of tension and uncertainty, great characters who are flawed but sympathetic, and enjoyable escapist literature.  If that sounds enticing, then go for it and enjoy.",positive,book

3736,"The Classmate Murders, by Bob Moat had me squirming deeper into my recliner and reaching for my bag of Oreos by the end of chapter one. Jim Richards, Moats fictional senior sluith, pulled me into his easy going, semi slothful life-style and made me feel comfortable and welcome in his parent's home, as he discovered that a classmate from forty years earlier had been murdered. Jim's  life of acceptance of growing old, and his prospects for the future not the best for a man his age, melted away in an instant of sentement and memory at the loss of his friend. Jim's mental gears start to turn slowly as he ponders why the dead person had reached out to him in her final moments of life: Him,the class nerd, him the shy unassuming class photographer, him, always invited, but never missed if he didn't show. A cunning and methodical mind is quickly revealed as he searches for answers. When the second classmate is murdered, Jim is up to his not-so-slim waist in mystery and intrigue, always two steps behind the murderer. When the body of a third friend shows up, Jim has picked up enough clues through bird dog tenacity,and a hound's sense of smelling out trouble,that he has a suspect in his sights and is zeroing in for the bust. Suddenly, the hunt turns and Jim is the target, possibly the next victim, or so he suspects, but the real target is the new love in his life, Penny, the girl that had a secret crush on Jim when they were in High School. Jim is caught off guard that such a beauty would have any interest in him, backin the day, and even now, when she reveals her long hidden secret of love for Jim. In spite of this new-found love late in life, Jim stays focused on finding the murderer. What happens next is close up tangles with the murderer, Shoot outs, high speed chases, close calls for Jim and Penny. The last chapter had me pacing my den floor, oreo crumbs trailed behind me, the sun peeking in through the closed blinds...thank God for sick days. By 9:00 A.M.

10621,"Who knew you could find the love of your life at the wedding from hell...Konigsburg, Book 2Janie Dupree will do anything to make sure her best friend has the wedding of her dreams, even if it means relinquishing what every bridesmaid covets and never gets--the perfect maid-of-honor dress. Problem is, family drama as tangled as a clump of Texas prickly pear cactus threatens to send the skittish bride hopping aboard the elopement express.Janie could use a hand, but the best man's ""help"" is only making things worse.Pete Toleffson just wants to get through his brother's wedding and get back to his county attorney job in Des Moines. He never expected to be the engineer on a wedding train that's derailing straight toward hell. Janie's the kind of girl he'd like to get close to--but her self-induced role as ""Miss Fix-It"" is as infuriating as it is adorable.If they can just fend off meddling parents, vindictive in-laws, spiteful ex-boyfriends, and a greyhound named Olive long enough to achieve matrimonial lift-off, maybe they can admit they're head-over-heels in love.Benjamin definitely didn't disappoint with this one either! Pete came to Texas thinking that all he wanted to do was get back to his job that was (literally) making him sick and all Janie wanted was for Pete to step up and take on the role he was here to be... best man. Pete found out pretty quickly that he wasn't going to be able to push Janie away and leave as quickly as he came. (from goodreads)Benjamin did a wonderful job showing Janie as the strong, independent woman that she so desperately wanted to be and yet couldn't get away from those who were weighing her down (namely her mom and loser-boyfriend type). I love Janie and her take charge attitude. She and Pete were trying to be the calm amidst a tornado and try to take care of each other at the same time... but they quickly found that they were both hurting each other by not telling the truth all along.If you have ever been in, planned, or even watched the planning of a wedding you know that it is chaotic. Benjamin adds to that tenfold all while weaving the romance of Janie and Pete into the mix. I found myself laughing, teary eyed, angry and comforted throughout this book and can't wait to see where Lars (the next hunky brother) takes us next. I only wish there were more Toleffson's because there can only be so many more books! Guess I will just have to re-read!!",positive,book

7151,"When I first started reading this e-book, I really did not think I would finish it. The story resembled something  written for young teens, the characters flat, the story rushed. Luckily I was bored  and had nothing else to read so i stuck with it. Once they got out of the building the character's personalities grew as did the story. It bloomed out dragging you along by introducing a new form of  ""smart"" zombies but kept the ""shamblers"". The ""Smart"" zombies kept their thoughts and personality from before they were changed, grew smarter, could talk and became stronger the more they fed, and the ""shamblers"" were just your traditional stupid, non talking ""brainnnnnns"" type. Even though i am a die hard ""brainnnnns"" fan, I liked the new smart zombies. I liked how it showed the story from the zombies point of view. It was more of ""evolution"" than a ""invasion"" of zombies. Its about time zombies became as smart as vampires and take their place as something that could form its own society to feed off the weaker humans. Its soooo nice to see them as something other than a monster to just fear and bash their heads in. I can see great possibilities for the story to grow out to a new world order type thing where the zombies become the dominate species and humans battle for a spot to live and not be food.The typos and mis-labeled/named characters were distracting and confusing. There is a part where Nancy is slapping Jimbo and it says Fred. I had to read that section several times to understand it. And then there is a chapter that ends with just the end half a sentence hanging. It makes you wonder what you missed.Over all for the price I paid to read the story, it was totally worth it. I am intrigued and off to buy the others by Mark Clodi. I totally recommend it as a read, just take the errors with a smile, no one is perfect.",positive,book

311,"I enjoyed this story by Kallysten (as I have all that I've read by her).  Brett is human and the owner of On The Edge, a club that caters to both vampires and humans.  Lisa is his vampire lover and silent partner.  They have a good relationship, one that isn't the usual vampire-human one in that Lisa hasn't bitten Brett (she doesn't want to see him as food).  She is on the hunt one evening in the club and is surprised to see Leo, her old lover and fellow vampire.  She couldn't remember why they had parted 15 years ago but found it wonderful to be in Leo's arms again.  From this point on, (no I'm not going to spoil it for you), you read about how Lisa, Brett and Leo develop a relationship between themselves.  It is a hot and spicy read and I am looking forward to reading the next story, Over The Edge, that continues Brett, Lisa and Leo's story.I received an ebook from the author for the purpose of an honest review.

In our time, too many of us can see the interest of the few being more important than the saving of the many. It is just too real in my mind that there are powerful, rich, and poor people on this earth that do not feel anything for anyone outside of their own group, be it family, friends, and/or a specific church.

7085,"Wasn't Jacob a bit creepy in this book? I've always regarded him as the rock upon which Victor could stand, but he kept me on the edge until the end of the book. And, beware, the end of the book is open, I was for once glad for the insight on the first chapter ofCamp Hell: A Psycop Novel.I loved the story. For once it's Jacob who's having difficulties in his case and Victor (with a distressed Lisa) come to the rescue. In the previous books Jacob was the one in control, but in this book the single-mindedness with which he pursues both the resolution of his case and Victor borders on possession. Victor for once seems to be able to assert himself, even the way he embraces his jealousy was a surprise for me. He no longer accepts things at their face value, on the contrary, he questions his future and his past and he begins to handle his psychic ability.Jacob and Victor are changing and I really want to see what they become in the next book.",positive,book

4801,"I must admit that I really like historical novels.That being said, this is a very unique book.It provides the historical story of Malintzin Tenepal, the hereditary Princess of Quetzalcoatl, who became known as La Malinche during the Conquest of Montezuma's Mexico by Spain's Cortez.  It fills in some gaps in historical knowledge, as all historical novels do, with speculation.  This makes the story flow. And at the end we are not sure but that Montezuma's Treasure may have been left as this story suggests.The book combines this adventure with a modern-day search for that very Treasure. And this takes place in tandem. We get a little of the current story and then we switch to the historical one and follow that. Intertwined.  This can be disconcerting.  Just as you get involved in Mexican border wars we switch to conquistadors on horseback.  But I thought this just made the whole better.And add to the mix the frequent transcriptions of a Mexican talk-radio reports to move the action along.Clever literary devices that will can spark your interest.The author has managed to tell the story of La Malinche and the Spanish Conquest and to describe the potential of a Mexican government melt-down while providing a colorful description of the heritage of the Americas.A terrific read.",positive,book

1770,"All to the stories in this volume are really good. Starting with the Red Thumb Mark, then John Thorndyke's Cases, The Eye of Osiris and the Mystery of 31 New Inn.  Dr. Thorndyke's Cases consisted of 8 separate cases, The Man with the Nailed Shoes, The Stranger's Latchkey, The Anthropologist at Large, The Blue Sequin, The Moabite Cipher, The Mandarin's Pear, The Aluminum Dagger, and The Message from the Deep Sea.In each of these stories the reader is treated to Dr. Thorndyke's extreme powers of observation, his ability to use the relevant facts and clues to the mysteries and incidents, his remarkable use of the science and technology of his day to resolve known issues and clues, his lack of assumptions when given red herrings and false leads as well as his ability to be his own investigator.The reader also is presented with the same details as Dr. Thorndyke, but the reader too is given a face saving out if they don't come to the same conclusions as Dr. Thorndyke, because Dr. Jervis, Thorndyke's partner and foil, never seems to get it either and like the reader doesn't always have Thorndyke's extreme and diversified knowledge at their fingertips or memory cells.All in all I look forward to reading all of R. Austin Freeman's books, even though he does seem to go on on with some of his discussions, which sometimes aren't needed for the story, and is somewhat recondite with his writings - I have used my Kindle's dictionary feature quite extensively.These stories are also very informative in teaching the reader what the prevalent scientific knowledge and technologies were, relative to their applications to CSI as fostered by Freeman, in the very early 1900's (1907, 1907, 1911, & 1912).I really think some enterprising movie or TV director/producer ought to take these stories and develop them into a good series.  Not enough people are familiar with R.

Throughout the story you are kept guessing because you are not sure what is real and what has been imagined from that tormented mind -- it gives you a glimpse into the mind of someone who suffers from this.The plot moves fast, right from the beginning, and the story keeps you guessing ""who dunnit"" until the end.For this price, you are getting MORE than you deserve in terms of entertainment value.I am keeping Eric Christopherson on my radar for future novels.",positive,book

To make matters worse she discovers that she is actually his second wife and that their entire life in California has been built on a lie.  Just when she thought that she couldn't take anymore, she is totally devastated when her husband cuts all ties with her and rushes home to Dundee determined to try and get his first wife to forgive him.  Unable to believe that he could totally abandon her and their children she follows him to Dundee.  With the marriage of Elizabeth's brother Isaac to her husband's first wife Reenie (Big Girls Don't Cry Harlequin Super Romance #1296) the next year finds Elizabeth and Reenie forming a family with their children.  Now Reenie has tried a little matchmaking, arranging a date between Elizabeth and Carter Hudson.  At first Carter and Elizabeth don't like each other, but the more time they spend with each other the more they come to care.  However, Carter tragically lost the woman he loved and Elizabeth is determined that she will never be second best again.The Other Woman touches upon every woman's feelings of rejection.  Both Carter and Elizabeth must deal with their pasts before they find a future together.  Although The Other Woman can stand alone, I recommend that readers first pick up Reenie's story, Big Girl's Don't Cry (Harlequin Super Romance #1296), as it is not only a great read but also will adds the background to this story. Brenda Novak has written a romance with truly complex relationships that keep the reader turning the pages and keeps them engrossed in the story until the last page.MelissaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",positive,book
713,"I read this a while back and really enjoyed it. This is firmly in the erotic romance category, so people who are not looking for a very explicit tale will not enjoy this story.""Pearl"" is about a recently married couple. The husband has spent a lot of time at sea and a lot of time exploring his desires. He wants his wife very much, but he presumes she is too much of a lady to enjoy bondage or anything other than the most routine bedroom activities. His wife, having witnessed the games of others, would very much like to branch out, but is unable to communicate this to her husband. Then, there's a business trip, the discovery of a secret room, and the discovery of the discovery of the secret room. Also, the discovery of naughty sketches and the discovery of the discovery -- well, you get it.If you're looking for a short tale with a focus on the erotic between a married couple and containing loving dominance, this would most likely be a worthwhile selection. An excellent choice for when you're not looking for a complicated plot or are overloaded on a lot of serious non-fiction.",positive,book
5626,"The story begins with our heroine, Becca, putting up a display in a museum. She has never really been comfortable with her life and is completely obsessed with the pirate she's about to put on display. That pirate is James Morrow, who did a lot of his pirating in the early 1700's. Becca was so obsessed with the age and the pirate she even learned how to fence. So, as she's putting the display up, she decides to test a sword that came with all the other items, thus taking her back in time to Captain Morrow's ship. I didn't realize when I purchased Treasured that it was sort of a Time Travel novella. I may not have purchased it had I known, but I am quite happy I did buy and read it!Apparently Becca could basically have been twins with James's wife Rebecca. No one on board liked the original wife and quite frankly she despised them all. Becca, however, fits in better than she ever did in what she had known as her time. It is very amusing how James doesn't understand the sudden changes in his wife. She never liked having sex with him, and didn't like him at all. Now, all of a sudden, Becca can't get enough smexy time with him, and vice versa. This is such a quick, fun and hot read!This was my favorite pirate story before I read any of Maureen O. Betita's The Kraken's Caribbean stories starting withThe Kraken's Mirror (The Kraken's Caribbean),The Chameleon Goggles (The Kraken's Caribbean)andThe Pirate Circus (The Kraken's Caribbean).In general I don't like time travel stories, but Ms. Jordan handled it well.

405,"In Chicago, her five overly protective older brothers and her Italian parents are driving Lottie Santori crazy as they leave her with no breathing room.  Being the only female and the youngest, she enjoys any opportunity to escape from their constant vigil.  Thus she looks forward to her out of town work in Trouble, Pennsylvania to conduct on site research into a serial killer who owned Seaton House though she doubts she will find any sexual relief in the small town.At Seaton House, Lottie meets new owner Simon Lebeaux, who inherited the old hotel from his late uncle.  She immediately revises her thoughts that Trouble means abstinence.  However, several accidents occur including some near fatal ones as if someone wants to prevent Lottie from completing her assignment.  Simon thinks the hotel is haunted, but Lottie believes a mortal person wants her stopped.The sequel to the amusing contemporary HERE COMES TROUBLE is a delightful investigative romance in which the lead couple explores the haunting of the hotel and their hearts.  The story line contains plenty of action, but it is the lead couple who keeps it focused and entertaining as she knows what she wants (sex not a lasting love) and he knows she is trouble (he has enough tsuris without her).  The trouble with this novel is that Leslie Kelly will keep her audience up late reading in one sitting.Harriet Klausner",positive,book

The dream featuring a blanket, Phil insisting Thom resembles one of his favorite carton characters (no spoiler here) have me chuckling aloud.Thom and Phil are so different in character but that is where the fun is. Phil annoying Thom because he finds a fired-up Thom so sexy is just comical. And it is nice to have the seemingly submissive Phil in their relationship so possessive and protective over Thom, who is forced to be tough throughout his life because of his smaller physique and pretty face.Of course Ally manages to inject some angsy moments into her romance too. I have a fun time reading this one and I thought Thom, who has nothing in the beginning of the story, finally finding a home with Phil is just touching.",positive,book
7700,"For many years, Meli Galdes serves as her family's ""unofficial"" assassin, and she is a very good one at that. Her family's last assignment for her was to do away with Celino Carvanna, the man who has hurt her in the past.When Celino saw her, he didn't remember her from the awkward girl he knew from before. All he was aware of was being captivated by her, and he would do anything to possess her.I picked up this book on the recommendation of a friend, and I'm glad I did.Though Ilona Andrews introduced a new world in this short read, the setting wasn't hard to understand, perhaps because it was patterned after the Mafia of our world, but it's more than that. The author gave just the right amount of description in order to help the readers understand the Kinsmen world, and she did it without info dumping or sounding tedious.I also like her characters, especially Meli who is the quintessential strong woman, and who rose from the ashes of her vulnerability and past pain without turning hard, enabling me to sympathize with her. I like that Meli didn't immediately fly into Celino's arms when he declared his feelings for her, as had happened in so many books I have read in the past. To the end, Meli was her own woman, forged in the fire of her experiences and the situations life--or people--has dealt her. I have long wanted to read a heroine who's strong like Meli and this story didn't disappoint. I was expecting a twist, but when it came, I was still caught by surprise. It was brilliant and oh-so-right for this story. Get this book, and you won't be sorry. Suffice it to say, I'm looking forward to more books in the Kinsmen world.",positive,book

6720,"This authorized 2-volume set (joined into one fabulous ebook) from Random House/Bantam contains ALL the Sherlock Holmes novels and ALL the collections of Sherlock Holmes short stories, including ALL the stories in ""The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes"" frequently omitted from some other so-called ""complete"" sets; this set truly is 100% complete. EVERYTHING Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ever wrote about Sherlock Holmes is here: all 4 novels and all 56 short stories. The informative introduction by Loren D. Estleman is an added bonus (though it appears twice in this ebook version, once at the start of each of the 2 volumes as originally published in paperback by Bantam). This ebook edition is very well-formatted, comfortable to read, has an active TOC (in which the short stories are presented in proper order), and even accurately depicts the graphic representations in ""The Dancing Men,"" unlike many other versions which substitute the word ""graphics"" for the drawings. This is undoubtedly the very best Sherlock Holmes collection currently available in the Kindle Store. (The non-Holmes set of 10 ""Tales of Mystery and Terror"" is sometimes added to incomplete Holmes sets to boost their story total. There is no need for this complete Sherlock Holmes set to do so, but if you want it, ""Tales of Mystery and Terror"" is easily obtained separately as a public domain freebie in the Kindle Store.) So if you love reading these beloved classic Sherlock Holmes mysteries, this is THE ebook edition to purchase--and paying only $2.99 for Bantam quality (rather than going with some incomplete, unauthorized, no-name, ebook bundler) is a very good deal.ADDENDUM: Since the above was written Maplewood Books has come out with a now updated and truly complete edition of its own at 1/3 the price of this Bantam version.

When he finds out she is moving back to town, his heart jumps for joy, all the while knowing that she probably won't even look at a man like him.Veronica Abbott has to get out from under her parents control, even though she has been married and widowed.  Moving back to her hometown, she decides to open a romance shop.  Taking a basket to the local fire department as a thank you for saving her childhood home from burning down, Veronica walks into the locker room and comes face to face with Dean Wolcott; the object of her secret teenage crush.  Veronica then proceeds to show him just how much she has missed him and is attracted to him.Dean wants Veronica with every ounce of his being.  He doesn't want to be her part time lover, he wants to be the love of her life forever.  He promises to give her time but is unsure if a girl like her will ever love him.Caught Off Guard was a naughty look at two people whose childhood crushes were still alive and strong years later.  I fell in love with Dean completely and absolutely because his intentions were so loving and so honorable.  I found myself wincing with Veronica's mannerisms and blatant sexuality, but after realizing how she wanted to finally be free from being controlled, I could see where she was coming from.  Caught Off Guard by Tonya Ramagos was a delightful read. I liked the plot and love when true love prevails!Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",positive,book

The main characters are so fully developed it could easily give you nightmares.  However, if you can stomach it, I loved this book.  Actually, its more a short story, with long lasting effects.  But with it's evilness, there is humor.  I found Jack Kilborn style of writing intense, and so thrilling.  This book is horror, at it's best.",positive,book

5106,"This is a little discovery. I have this book since a bit, but for one reason or the other, I wait to a lot before reading it. And I immediately discovered my mistake cause since the first pages you can understand that this is a great romance, that the fans of the genre will love.Alex is a wasp FBI Special Agent who has fought all his life to avoid the innuendo from friends or colleague about him being gay. Actually he has never desired men, he loves women and finds very attractive all the women are. Only he is also a very uptight middle-classe man, who loves to grew roses, write poems and paint. And since he is also an handsome, but not bulky man, he is always mistaken for a gay man.So when he is undercover with Shawn, a big Australian Special Agent, very manly and handsome, he is totally unprepared when the big guy hits on him, and openly declares his attraction for him and the desire to be his lover... in the submissive position! True, they are undercover as gay lovers, but it's not necessary to play the role when they are alone in their house, but Shawn has no restrain and in the end he manages to involve Alex in an hot relationship. But when their mission ends, what will remain to them? They are teammate and the Agency maybe will be not so happy to have two agents involved in an open gay relationship.I like very much as T.D. McKinney manages to mix romance with reality. True, some scenes are really stretched to the limit of reality (Shawn's woo of Alex), but hey, this is a romance, and I like to read those things, they appeal to the ultimate romantic who is in me. But Alex is also a character who thinks and before throws himself in a relationship with Shawn, he works very hard trying to drive him back. Shawn instead is the dream of every woman, and man maybe: attentive and loving, the right dose of push and comprehensive attitude.It's really interesting to read the dichotomy between Shawn, with his bulky body, who is instead the more feely touching and exuberant in the couple, and Alex, who I envision like the classical prim and proper character, who seems cold and aloof, but when they threaten his lover, he reacts like a poisonous snake: silent but deadly.Only one remarks, very minimal indeed: T.D: McKinney is very good in writing the sex scenes, build them with a growing pathos, but she shut the doors in the apex... why does she not let peep in a little more?",positive,book
5314,"I enjoy the Wall Street Journal, but being a daily publication, I wanted more up-to-date news breaks.  The NY Times Blog solves the issue.It pumps news stories to the Kindle every 3-4 hours, and the stories appear to be comprehensive, well-written, each about 1000 words long, and there are approximately 8-12 headlines active at a time.  So, it is not the NY Times newspaper itself regarding content amount, but getting thousands of words of up to date info effortlessly every few hours, 24/7, is well worth the $1.99 monthly. The stories are more timely than even the NY Times subscription newspaper.I have used the experimental web feature of the Kindle to secure news stories, and while that works also, it is more cumbersome, slower, takes more clicks of the wheel, and it not a neat and tidy as having active headlines 24/7 ""pushed"" to the device.I did the trial subscription to Reuters headlines and found it far inferior to the NY Times Headlines for content, photos, navigability, and writing quality.  Try both the Times and the Reuters and the difference will stun you.The NY Times blog even has photos for almost every article that are good quality, and is easy to navigate and read.

1094,"This is the fifth book in the original six book Lost Fleet series.  I consider this to be the best Space Opera series which I have read.  After 4 books of tactical genius and reasoned risks, Captain Geary and the Alliance Fleet are within a handful of jumps to Alliance space.  Captain Geary struggles as the risks seem more tangible as their final destination seems so close.  Fleet opponents become more desperate as they realize that there is little time to displace Captain Geary.  The Syndics are not content to be counted out and still have some cards to play on the seemingly invincible Alliance fleet.  Many plot lines come to epic conclusion in this book which I find has the best ending of any of the books in the original Lost Fleet series.Each book builds on the previous so it is important to read the books in order.  The first Lost Fleet Series consists ofThe Lost Fleet: Dauntless,The Lost Fleet: Fearless,The Lost Fleet: Courageous,The Lost Fleet: Valiant,The Lost Fleet: RelentlessandThe Lost Fleet: Victorious.  Author has also started a new series,The Lost Fleet: Beyond the Frontier: Invincible, in the same universe.The Lost Fleet: Relentless is 4,548 Kindle locations long.

7731,"What a great novella and prequel into the new Guild Hunter series.  This is my first time reading anything from Nalini Singh and I really enjoyed this story.  The world that Nalini has built is both innovative and exciting.  Hunters (humans) are employed by the Guild who are essentially angels, to hunt down vampires that go against their contract w/ the angels.  Vampires are ""almost-immortals"" and are sired and indentured by the angels.  Angels are not the angels from the fairy tales of sugar and spice, these angels are cruel and twisted and thrive on the pain of others.  In this novella we follow a hunter named Ashwini who is hired by the powerful angel Nazarach.  Her assignment is to travel down to Atlanta and hunt down a vampire who has been kidnapped by a rival.  To succeed in her mission Ashwini persuades a vampire (Janvier), who has escaped being terminated by her on more than one occasion, to accompany her.  Ashwini and Janvier have great chemistry and seem to make a great team.  There is a lot of sexually charged tension between them.  There is quite a bit of action and suspense packed into this novella.  I look forward to the first book in the series Angel's Blood, due out 3/3/09.I also recommend:Bloodring: A Rogue Mage NovelSuccubus Dreams (Georgina Kincaid, Book 3)The Touch of Twilight (Sign of the Zodiac, Book 3)Hotter Than Hell (Hell on Earth, Book 3)In the BloodThe Iron Hunt",positive,book
6215,"When I first started reading M/M, I purposely avoided ""cowboy romances"" because they seemed clich&eacute;.  However, I am quickly finding they can be quite good and my opinion has changed.  I love the Cattle Valley series by Carol Lynne, so when I saw this novella from TA Chase (who I have read and enjoyed before) I went for it.The story is a fairly straightforward romance.  Tyler and JT are twins, and Tyler has always been the follower, taking care of JT on the rodeo circuit.  Until he finally decides he needs a life of his own, possibly with the handsome horse breeder Ren, that he can't get out of his heart.  There is angst in the story (JT having slept with said horse breeder simply b/c Tyler wanted him!) but it is nothing heartrending and easily overcome by the couple - as it should be in a novella that doesn't have the time or scope to expand.  The sex (I know you romance junkies are wondering) was excellent, better than I find in most short stories/novellas.  Chase throws a bit of kink into the mix, so it's not vanilla, but it is also far from BDSM.  A little bondage and some spanking heat the sex up very satisfyingly without tipping into uncomfortable.  I could easily reread this story again.A couple things did annoy me, such as Tyler constantly referring to Ren as ""the older man"" and the somewhat abrupt ending.  There was the requisite HEA, but a couple more paragraphs would have ended it more smoothly. Overall though, it was a very good story and I actually hope there'll be a sequel with JT.",positive,book
5257,"Optometrist Adrian Giordano isn't looking for a mate.  He's quite content with his life exactly as it is - a successful business, friends and occasionally even dating.  His best friends have both succumbed to their instincts and mated but Adrian shudders at the thought of being accountable to a mate.  At least that's what he thought before meeting Sheri.  Now he can't imagine his life without her.  All he has to do is convince her that he's the only man for her.Sheridan Montgomery has recently joined the Pride.  She's been resistant to joining the pack because of her ex's obsessive behavior and she didn't want to drag anyone else into her mess but she's running out of options.  Instinctively Sheri knows that Adrian is her mate but she's determined to deny it as long as Parker remains a threat.The Pride welcomes Sheri with open arms - and after hearing her story a network of protection is put in force.  Sheri's thrilled with her new friends, home and part time job working at Wallflowers.  Her only real worry is how long it will be before Parker makes a move.  She's successfully ignored her Puma's need for Adrian and continues to deny it to herself and everyone around her.  It's the only way she can protect him - or so she thinks.  Fortunately, Adrian isn't willing to wait for her to come to her senses and he practically kidnaps her and carries her off to his home where he claims her properly.Just when it seems that Sheri could have a real life free of worry over Parker's next move he strikes.  All Sheri's desires to protect Adrian fall by the wayside as it's determined that he is the Pride Marshall.  It's his duty to protect the Alpha and the Pride from threats and he takes his duty very seriously.  No psycho wolf in men's clothing is going to harm his mate or anyone in his pack and live to tell about it.  Of course like any feline he'll have to torment his prey a little before going in for the kill.CAT OF A DIFFERENT COLOR is the third story in Dana Marie Bell's HALLE PUMAS series.  I've thoroughly enjoyed all the stories in this series but this one really stands out.  The characters are larger than life, ballsy, lovable and flawed and because of that they seem very real.  If I wasn't in love with the PRIDE before I certainly am now!  Sheri's caring and generous nature makes her a genuinely likeable character but when you add her disabilities into the equation then she's truly an inspiration.  Adrian's simply delightful and perfect for Sheri because he is so protective and he isn't swayed by her arguments.In addition to the normal cast of characters we've come to know and love in the HALLE PUMAS series we're introduced to another character in particular, Richard, the new Alpha of the Wolf Pack in the Poconos.  There's a showdown between him and Belinda, a Pride member who's having difficulties finding acceptance in the Pride.If you haven't read the other titles in this series, I'd highly recommend doing so - not because it's necessary to understand this book but because they're delightfully fun.

3361,"With his best friend tying the knot, Navy SEAL Carson Scott is considering saying goodbye to his short-term fling ways.  When he meets an incredibly sexy brunette who rocks his world in an all-too-brief erotic encounter, Carson is left wanting more...and wanting her.Holly Lawson doesn't have time for relationships.  She just broke up with a demanding ex, she wants to start her own restaurant, and her family members are constantly getting themselves into trouble.  A one-night stand is just what she needed.  Then said one-night stand shows up at a wedding she's catering and Holly finds she can't resist the attraction between them.  But where she wants a fling, Carson wants a relationship.  Holly's about to learn just how determined one sexy SEAL can be.One thing's for sure - Heat of Passion is hot, hot, HOT!  Elle Kennedy delivers a wonderful romance that'll make you smile even as it makes you sweat.I first fell in love with Carson in the first Out of Uniform story, Heat of the Moment.  With his sensual, charming exterior and the caring soul that lies beneath, how can one not fall in love with Carson?  He is everything worth drooling over, so it's easy to find why Holly found him impossible to resist.  As for the woman who catches the heart of said playboy?  Holly is a bright, loving soul who has been burned by a past relationship gone sour.  Her fears of giving all of herself in a full-fledged relationship are understandable, but I really enjoyed watching Carson try to break through to her.While Heat of Passion is the second book in the Out of Uniform series, each story fully stands on its own.

3705,"Jane Austen. Her name is practically synonymous with classic, understated romance, as well as comedies of manners with a subtle, sly sense of humor.  And ""Jane Austen: The Complete Collection"" brings together the full complement of Austen's, from her little-known nonfiction to the classic bestseller ""Pride and Prejudice"" (and everything in between) -- lots of lovably flawed heroines, beautiful formal prose, and some rather unconventional love stories.The collection includes Austen's most famous six novels, which explore love, societal demands, honor and independent thought -- a girl meddling in people's lives, two sisters with completely different romantic approaches, an ""old maid"" whose fiance returns to England, a poor relation whose moral standards are challenges, a hyper-romantic gothic-novel fan whose imagination runs amuck, and a slow-blooming love between a proud man and a prejudiced woman.That's normally where people's acquaintance with Austen ends. But she actually wrote a number of other things -- a brilliantly manipulative widow who seduces, plots and schemes; her ""History of England""; two unfinished novels, ""The Watsons"" and ""Sanditon""; some letters; and some bits of her juvenalia, including some funny early spoofs and her ""scraps.""This collection displays the range and depth of Austen's writing skill beautifully; though each story is very unique they're laced together by common themes. Her main novels are all love stories, tempered with some clever commentary on the society of Austen's day (example: entailment), and a biting, sharp-edged wit. But we also see her more openly comedic side (""Love and Freindship,"" a parody she wrote early on).And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen's writing was brilliant -- there's a bit of roughness in ""Lady Susan"" and ""Persuasion,"" but nothing too dramatic. Each one has powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (""The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows""), as well as deliciously witty dialogue (""I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine""). But she also writes some intensely romantic moments as well (""Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you"").Austen also had an interesting range of heroines -- quiet ones, melodramatic ones, intelligent ones, naive ones, and mildly spoiled ones who think they know best. But each one has a major character flaw that must be overcome before she can find true love and happiness And she has an equally fascinating range of love interests: quiet, shy older men, sexy clever ones, blunt ones, generous honest ones, and especially the smart, sexy Mr. Darcy (who has a flaw of his own to overcome alongside Lizzie).""Jane Austen: The Complete Collection"" draws together almost all the work that Jane Austen ever produced, and let readers explore the mannered society and obstacle-filled love lives of her heroines. Brilliant, and a must-read for any reader.",positive,book

7238,"I actually started reading this book at least 3 times before actually reading it cover to cover (in one day, I might add).  In fact I only decided to start reading it again because nothing else seemed interesting. Call it ""reader's block"".  On rare ocasions I actually have to force feed my eyes and brain, so I held no hope this book would break my current block, but I thought, ""What the heck and read a page on and off throughout the day until finally something hit my senses and a few hours later I was looking for the sequel!No spoilers here.  Touching love story about two people who thought they were set in their lives and futures until seeing each other for the first time.  Over an extremely short period of time they come to know more about each other and therefore themselves than they wanted to remember.  As one learns strength and the other rediscovers the hope in living, a tragedy looms its head. Ms McCay details each main characters past as they discover possible futures with a little humor thrown in for our pleasure.  My only regret is not finding a sequel ...

Don't get me wrong, Warwick was a brutally strong hot male character-but we were so privy to his thoughts within this story that we began to get those protective feelings Aidan acquired. We saw the extremely handsome man Warwick really was.The passion and romace are well mixed with so much strengh and wit from both characters that sometimes you're not sure who the real Hero should be in this story.For everyone who likes the strong-take matters into her own hands Heroines--this is definately the book for you!

I can see how some would have issues with the age differences between a few of the couples...but not long ago females were considered ""old maids"" if they had not married by 20. In fact how old were your Grandparents or Great Grandparents when they married? Most readers will realise that this is an extinction level event so it is human nature to want to couple and survive. Others have also mentioned that they couldn't find the main character believable. I have known young teens that had the budding intelligence and maturity to make me accept that it is plausible.I would love to read Jacobs point of view. I found him very interesting.

2302,"Where to start?  I wish I had read TIDAL WAVE sooner.  I loved Alexia and Joshua.  In fact, I believe that, after the ""dream"" scene betwixt the two, the childhood memory is one of my favorite parts.  It's so cute and innocent, and I think Vivan really captured how a young boy would act when being teased by the older boys in his family.  And then Alexia's innocence during the entire interaction... It made me smile.My all time favorite part of this book definitely had to be the scene when the two sleep together for the first time.  It's so tender... so loving.  I really got a sense of Joshua's love for Alexia, and I absolutely ADORED the fact that he would risk getting in trouble just to keep her safe.  Love love love!I wasn't entirely crazy about the dominance switch about halfway into the novel.  After Alexia rebukes Joshua for lying, it's like his character transforms from a dominating alpha into a little kitten with the alpha lurking under the surface... which is cute, but he simmers down in the bedroom a teensy bit.  And then Anthony, who was initially the little kitten, transforms into this dominating sex god.  Kind of weird, but hey, who doesn't love a guy who's confident in bed?  Plus, he did it for Alexia--since he knew she was too shy to start talking dirty--which makes him that more respectable in my eyes.Anthony had to grow on me, especially since I was shipping Alexia/Joshua from the start.  I'm not entirely a fan of threesomes in stories, however, this series--or more specifically, TIDAL WAVE--has made me a bit more open-minded about reading it.  But only by Vivian.  She doesn't make her sex scenes tacky.I loved the fact that, despite the story's length, there was plenty of room for character growth.  Alexia transformed from this shy, mortified creature into a true leader.  It was fun being able to witness that growth, and it was written eloquently.Just like all of her other stories, TIDAL WAVE ended on the perfect note.  I was absolutely satisfied with everything about it.  And Anthony kicked the bad guy's butt.  Woot!If you're like me and you don't read a lot of threesome stories, for whatever reason, TIDAL WAVE is the perfect introduction to this type of reading/writing.  Like I said, the sex isn't tacky, and you could tell that Alexia and Joshua really cared about each other (they were pretty much the ""main couple"" in my head, but you see the love with Anthony also, but I personally didn't find it as intense as Joshua's).  Definitely worth adding to your TBR piles.",positive,book

But for this book, that was a refreshing change. I loved finding out about Shane's family history, which helped explain the reasons and fears he had. Me personally, i will be grateful for all the little snippets that Lauren Dane gave us for the other members of The Warden Clan in Fated.

They have some serious ups and downs and have to fight not only to feed and house themselves in the high country, but also fight a couple of groups of vicious grownups who harass them.Their day to day planning as described in the book is excellent and the characters are well described. The tale moves at a satisfying pace and the adventure remains appealing from start to finish. I very much recommend this book. This is not a book about the fog, but about surviving the fog as the title states.Terry McDonald",positive,book

2145,"OK this is a Trilogy so I would highly recommend buying all three because once you start reading this book you will want to read them all.  The author was new to me but for a dollar I figured I'd take a chance.  I brought all three books and was glad I did because once I finished the first one I had to know what was going to happen next.  Is this a great work of fiction maybe not but it is worth your time.  I would say the biggest issue I had with the book was the editing.  It can be a little distracting when you find obvious typos but other than that the story moved along, the characters were well developed and I'll just have to wait to see how things turn out in the last book.  Again I would recommend this book if you like the classic good vs evil story.Get the next book in the series:The ORDER of SHADDAI (The Realm Shift Trilogy #2)",positive,book

Keep in mind that this is a 0.5 prequel to the regular series, so it's just a ""sampling"" of what's to come.  It may not make a whole lot of sense, but once you read book 1, you'll understand the reason for it.

6046,"*** spoiler alert ***I loved the story, loved the characters. It's impossible to talk about the book without revealing one of the major plot twists. The book is in two parts, the first is narrated by Gabriel Sandalini, an undercover cop who's young and restless. When the narration switches to Miguel Ortega, there is more than a change in the point-of-view, because we find out that Miguel Ortega is in fact Antonio Lorenzo, an FBI undercover agent.The first part has the same pace of Gabriel's personality: fast, dangerous, with little time to ponder. The second part mirrors Antonio's more reflective and patient attitude. In the first part we see how the two protagonists meet and how strong their attraction is; the second part shows how they stay together, how the attraction turns to love.I loved both Gabriel and Antonio and at the end of the book I think that both retained their mystery. We have glimpses of their past, but we never know how they came to be the men they are and what they bring into their relationship except for their attitudes toward life in general. While Gabriel seems to realize that he needs Antonio, his help and his dominance, as if Antonio were the only one who could contain is energy and heal his hurt, Antonio seems the one who is able to see inside Gabriel and pours his love onto the young and injured man, fulfilling his own need to love. The two complete each other on every level and in every aspect of their life.And it broke my heart, but I appreciated that the authors didn't choose the easy way of making Gabriel's injury temporary. It was bitter and it was better that we saw it through Antonio's eyes, because I am sure it would have been painful to know what Gabriel's thoughts were, but we got to see how Antonio reached out to him, enduring the bouts of anger and despair of his lover.I don't know if I'd like to know more about them, I must confess that for me the story is told, but if the sequel is written, I will surely read it.",positive,book

Blake keeps coming up with new ways to keep the story flowing and interesting along with the well written sex scenes as they keep hunting the demon's breech.The author supplied me with a copy of this manuscript with no request for a review; the opinions expressed are my honest opinions.

As a military veteran I have found this series to be a blast to read. The character development is such that you really get to know them and it hurts you when one of them is hurt or God forbid killed. The author makes it a point to let you know the good guy dosen't always win or live to see tomorrow. Do what I did and get the entire series and read them one right after the other.

Each story has its own flow--beginning, middle, end, and the book as a whole also has some great character growth.

6515,"Book Title: The Classmate MurdersAuthor: Bob MoatsPublisher: Magic1 ProductionASIN: B002D48NBOReviewed by Michele Tater for The Coach Tater ReviewMiddle age is when your old classmates are so gray and wrinkled and bald they don't recognize you. ~Bennett CerfJim Richards a sixty year old who lives with his parents and recently has lost his job as a security guard for a car dealership. He is an avid reader of reading and watching anything related to mystery; books, movies and television series. The book ""The Classmate Murders"" follows this older in body than mind, gentleman who leads a simple and somewhat boring life until he receives a disturbing e-mail from a high school classmate. She was actually an ex-girlfriend of his who was now afraid that someone wanted to take her life. Unfortunately, he receives that message too late and she is found dead with the message that there will be more murders to come. With his good friend Buck, Jim decides to use his learned investigation skills, no matter how limited, to try to solve the mystery before others are found dead. With team works so well together that the police seem to be one step behind them. Jim becomes an important part of the case, even with small matter he knows a little too much about the woman involved. He comes the conclusion that the women being threatened are cheerleaders from his high school. Who would want these women dead after forty years later and why.I must admit I didn't think that a story about a senior citizen wanna-be private investigator was going to be so entertaining, but was I wrong. This book proves that even an old dog can have a sharp mind to look at details and figure out leads to solve a difficult case.  With its  humor, and friendly banter between characters and with some steamy sexy scenes, this book packs a lot between its covers. Adults of any age would find the characters likable, the plot integrating, and will find it a great mystery. I liken it to a cup of tea brewed, not too hot and not too cold, sweet with a little honey with no need for the cream.",positive,book

2043,"Inside one of London's most exclusive clubs several gentlemen gather once a month to visit with one another.  As a diversion, Jonas Maxim suggests they each reveal their most daring sexual exploits.  After all, they are men and sex is one of their favorite subjects.  The Earl of Grayson requests the opportunity to be the first to share his tale...Robert St. Claire, Earl of Grayson is stunned with the Sultan's gift of a beautiful slave to see to his carnal needs during his visit.  He's not exactly comfortable with this unorthadox practice.  To further complicate matters, Robert learns that the woman meant for his pleasure is no ordinary slave girl.  She's English and the daughter of a friend.  If he has any chance of freeing her, he'll have to avail himself of her many charms and pray that the Sultan will allow him to take her with him when the time comes for him to leave.Lady Celia Davenport had been the belle of London society.  Then she was abducted, sold into slavery, and expected to pleasure a guest of the Sultan's is most overwhelming to her gentle breeding.  When she discovers that the man she is to service is English and knows her father, she is great relief.  She now has a smidgen of hope of being able to return home but only if she is submissive to Robert's desires and pleases him. Otherwise she may be lost to the harem for the rest of her life.Each night Celia is brought to Robert's room where they share a bed and indulge their growing passion for each other.  Neither of them is able to speak freely because they are watched through carefully constructed peep holes in the wall - in this manner the Sultan can be assured that indeed his guest is pleased with his generosity.  If she doesn't please him, she will immediately be punished and replaced.Fortunately Robert is a very skilled lover and goes out of his way to ensure that Celia enjoys each of their sessions just as much as he does.  After their first night together, the Sultan gifts Celia with four perfect pearls - one for each time the esteemed guest found satisfaction inside her body.  Over the two weeks that Robert is a guest, his feelings for Celia grow while he worries about the future. Will he be able to successfully rescue her from a lifetime of slavery in the harem?  If so, how is he going to explain all this to her father?Emma Wildes' BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB series is off to a brilliant start with this gem of a tale.  ARABIAN PEARL satisfies that wicked fantasy that many women have of being kidnaped and thrust into the life of a harem girl while still retaining a sense of independence and a hope for freedom.  I love how Celia changes throughout the storyline - she goes from a shy virgin to a self confident young woman who rejoices in her own sexuality.  Robert's blatant adoration of Celia really endears him to me.ARABIAN PEARL captured my interest from the very first page and held me enthralled right to the end.

I always like to know the 'why' behind a serial killer. But, that's just my personal preference.

It's not quite as gory, but there's a time and a place for everything. This novella hits the bull's eye for action/suspense fans who like a little blood and gore on the side.",positive,book
737,"I love Gothic Romances, especially paranormal ones, and not many are published anymore. So I was delighted to discover Touch Me in the Dark and read it with great pleasure. A spooky old Victorian, interesting characters, and a twisty story. For a different take, this story was set in an unusual place--Southern California--not where you'd expect to find a Gothic ghost story. But it works! Touch Me in the Dark is definitely worth reading!",positive,book
652,Lady Amelia has decided to take a lover.

They both enlist the help of his twin brother and renowned rake in achieving their true goal.It really is one of the funniest books I've read in a very long time - and Victoria Alexander is always a favorite!,positive,book

10015,"What is better than ruby red slippers, singing `Follow the Yellow Brick Road', and melting a wicked ole' witch with a bucket of water?Watching a M/M romance take place in the Land of Oz! Oh yes, you heard me right. In this new spin on The Wizard of Oz tale, a man named Kansas is sucked up in a `twister' and taken to the magical land of Orgy Oz. This would be my second M/M book and I have to say I totally get the appeal in the genre now. It is just hot to read about two Alpha males go at it with one another. Add in one sexy as all get up Wizard and you have a M/M/M scene that is so steamy you are nibbling on your bottom lip and begging for more.The story had every element of fantasy you can ask for. To top it all off you set it on the backdrop of one of the most famous fantasy tales of all time, and you have a fast paced, sexy, erotic romance that rivals some of the best in the genre.I loved this story. And not just because it was The Land of Oz orgy style, but it was well written, Land of Oz orgy style. I think anyone that has been looking for a great read, and erotic fantasy about Oz will love this book!

8911,"According to Twain, Heaven is years from earth, even when you are transported at .1 speed of light. It is huge, containing souls from multiple worlds, creatures only imagined by later SciFy authors. Multiple gates, minimal entry conditions. There is a caste system, and receptions for those who never received reward during life.I wish that wings were more than decoration, but according to Sandy, an elderly resident, you travel by WISHING yourself around to greet new arrivals, or return to earth with divine messages. Most inhabitants only dress up for formal occasions- halo, harp and wings being a sort of uniform.Sandy tells Stormfield: Heaven is a libertarian place- plenty of room, do as you please, appear any age- but it is not paradise as imagined on earth. Idleness does get old, and please do not irritate the patriarchs. Sandy is a keen observer of people in Heaven.The rest of the tale is similarly imaginative. Twain enlivens things by speaking in the argot of a 19th century sailing master, sprinkling dialogue with phrases like:' An ordinary comet don't make more than about 200,000 miles a minute.  Of course when I came across one of that sort--like Encke's and Halley's comets, for instance--it warn't anything but just a flash and a vanish, you see.  You couldn't rightly call it a race.  It was as if the comet was a gravel-train and I was a telegraph despatch.  But after I got outside of our astronomical system, I used to flush a comet occasionally that was something like.  We haven't got any such comets--ours don't begin.  One night I was swinging along at a good round gait, everything taut and trim, and the wind in my favor--I judged I was going about a million miles a minute--it might have been more, it couldn't have been less--when I flushed a most uncommonly big one about three points off my starboard bow.

She wholeheartedly loves them but nurturing their relationship has fallen by the wayside in their course to better their business.  It's their five year anniversary and she has some very exciting news but their neglect has her questioning if she should stay or kiss them goodbye.Logan and Rhys have invested a year's worth of time in securing the biggest contract of their business career.  Unfortunately the client keeps jerking them around.  In their determination to make more money they've lost sight of what's truly important - their unique relationship with Cat.  They soon realize that their drive for success could quite possibly cost them the love of their lives.It's been three months since Cat was last intimate with Logan and Rhys.  They've been too wrapped up in their business ventures to pay her much attention and she's sunk into a pit of despair and loneliness.  The men completely forgot about their anniversary dinner and then canceling out on their Jamaican vacation is just too much.  She's played second best for far too long.  Cat has every intention of going on this vacation - with or without them.  It will give her a chance to relax and reevaluate her situation.  What she doesn't expect is for her unexpected absence from their home to open Logan and Rhys eyes to the possibility of a life without her.  Logan and Rhys have made a success of their business but their marriage is on the verge of failure.  Will they find a way to balance the two or is it already too late to rectify the wrongs they've done to Cat?If you think being in a menage a trois relationship means that you'd never feel neglected or taken for granted then you're wrong.  In Maya Banks STAY WITH ME, Cat, Logan and Rhys are forced to face the fact they're all to blame for the break down in their marriage.  Cat's been too compliant and never voiced her unhappiness.  Logan and Rhys are so career driven that they didn't realize that they were hurting her by not being more attentive.

10252,"I am a huge Debbie Macomber fan, there's not too many books of hers that I haven't read.  After saying that, her best writing, in my opinion is her Cedar Cove series.  With 12 books total, the books follow a cast of characters through life and hardships.  The series starts with 16 Lighthouse road and ends with 1225 Christmas Tree Lane.  It's easy to know where you are in the series based on the title - the first number in the title is the corresponding number in the series.  Debbie Macomber's characters draw you in and make you feel as though you are part of the plot and by the time you have finished the book(s) you feel as though some of the characters are you best friends as with Olivia and Grace.  You meet them in 16 Lighthouse Rd and 204 Rosewood.  If you download this book/series, you won't be sorry.  Curl up in your favorite reading chair and be transported to Cedar Cove.

985,"Another well written story by Julie Miller. I really enjoyed reading it. Jack and Alex have a 15 year age difference between them but I like stories like these. I find the age difference to be kind of sweet. I only felt that the beginning was a little hard to accept.Unless I'm mistaken about his duty time, I would have liked for Jack and Alex to have met as they did while Jack was not on duty. He really knew nothing about her and for him to get this intimate with her in this type of situation didn't seem like an honorable decision. She really could have turned out to be much younger than she had told him she was. It also didn't work because immediately after being assaulted by one man she just met, she got intimate with another man she just met. Some of their scenes take place in car but it was a little confusing exactly how they were positioned. Also, just a small pet peeve of mine of littering, one of the characters just simply opens the window and dumps ""something"" right onto the street and he was a cop.Once you get past their initial meeting, the story is good with a good amount of suspense and romance!",positive,book

1845,"I was born not long after the end of World War II.  Some of my earliest memories are of hiding under the table out on my Grandma's porch listening to my Dad and all of my uncles talk about their experiences during the war.  World War II, and in particular the Holocaust, has always held a fascination (for want of a better word) for me. I've read countless books on the subject, watched dozens, perhaps hundreds, of hours of movies and documentaries, and even had a chance to see & hear about some of what happened first hand both here at home and living in Germany.In general, I do not approve of fiction when it comes to the Holocaust.  Let me tell you why.  This is an event that must never be forgotten, an event that some (all too many) deny ever happened, even with many survivors and combatants on both sides still alive. So, when I hear about something like ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"", first presented as a real event, then later declared to be a complete fiction by the authors themselves, I cringe.  It will not be long before all of the direct witnesses have passed.  Even my generation, the ones who heard the stories first hand, who saw the tattoos, who have walked the remnants of the battlegrounds, are getting on up there. Before too long, there will be nothing to witness except words written in a book.  Those words must be truth, not fantasy.  Otherwise, in 25 or 30 or 40 years people can simply point to a stack of made up books and say ""see - all fiction - never happened.""There are some cases, though, where a story is important to tell even if it must be told through the medium of fiction because there are no longer living witnesses - or perhaps never were.  One of those stories is the roundup,subsequent abandonment and final shipment to Auschwitz of more than 4,000 children in the Vel d'Hiv roundup in Paris, an action carried out by the French police on Petain's orders.  There were few survivors - a mere handful - and most of those were young children at the time.  Tatiana de Rosney does an excellent job of telling the story of this horrific event inSarah's Key.Until very recently even the fact that there WERE Jewish partisans was not particularly well known, at least not in popular mediums.  Leon Uris talks about the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising inExodus.  Rudi Weiss joins the Jewish partisans inHolocaust.  Only in the last few years has the story of the Bielski Brothers -The Bielski Brothers: The True Story of Three Men Who Defied the Nazis, Built a Village in the Forest, and Saved 1,200 JewsandDefiance- truly documented the Jewish Resistance.  As heroic as the Bielskis were, their group was not the only Jewish resistance group. It is vitally important that a couple of decades from now, when all who were there to witness or spoke to those who witnessed are gone, that people know that everyone did not march quietly to the slaughter like so many sheep, that the Bielskis were neither alone in their resistance nor an aberration. There is room in the historical record forThe Remnant - Stories of the Jewish Resistance in WWII.Othniel Seiden's story has its foundations in a great deal of research - interviews, records of the Nuremberg proceedings, diaries left behind by those who lived these events - and he has done a remarkable job of presenting characters that are accurate & compelling composites.Some have commented negatively on his portrayal of the role of the Roman Catholic Church in Hitler's Final Solution, particularly as regards the Pope in office at the time of World War II, a role that has been the subject of great debate over the years, debate that is not yet entirely settled.  The basic facts that Seiden addresses in this regard - that the Catholic Church had a pact with Hitler and that the Vatican helped thousands of Nazis to escape Europe at the end of World War II - are grounded in known, demonstrable facts.  It is only since the papacy of Pope John Paul II, himself a Polish seminary student during World War II, that there has been some attempt to rehabilitate the reputation of Pope Pius XII regarding his actions towards the Nazis and the ""Final Solution."" Had Seiden chosen to present this rehabilitative material, information that would have been unknown to the characters at the time during which these events occurred, would be to rewrite history.  That would be a grave error.Highly recommended.  This is worth your time to read.",positive,book

2426,"There have been enough comments regarding the content so I won't even discuss that.Several people have commented that this isn't long enough. Frankly, I think the length is one of the things that makes it as scary as it is. To take these 2 serial killers and put that much information and fear into one chapter for each of them then to bring them together in another chapter that wraps things up nicely, totally works for me. I also like the way the 2 authors worked independently and still made the story cohesive.After reading King and Koontz for the past 40 years and watching horror films longer than that, I really enjoyed this story. However, if you are squeamish don't read this.The way this was written intrigued me. I have read a few anthologies that are by a group of authors connecting their stories to make a whole. This is the second I have read where they alternate writing the same story and it was extremely well done.",positive,book

4016,"This book is a deserving winner of the prestigious Giller prize in 2008.  I've been wanting to read it for some time, but wanted to read Boyden's first book ""Three Day Road"" first.  As good as that book was, this one is even better.  But it was good to read Three Day Road first as it is a precursor to this one and helped me understand the characters a bit more.  Like Three Day Road, this book is so difficult to read in some ways because you keep waiting for the terrible, cataclysmic thing to happen.  And even though you know it's going to happen, it doesn't make it any less terrible when it does.  This book is also similar to Three Day Road as it told from the viewpoints of two different people.  Both Will and his young niece Annie have terrible stories to tell and each heals through the sharing of them.  I highly recommend this book, but I would suggest that you read Three Day Road first.  You will feel richer from the experience of enjoying superlative story telling.  Both books will take you up and out of your everyday life and into a magical world that seems so very real while you are there reading about it.",positive,book

3699,"Morgan had spent one wonderful week in Aruba. She met Bryan Cailborn. When Morgan got back home she found out that she was pregnant. She started contacting Bryan, but never got a reply. When she did get a reply Bryan said he didn't know her. Morgan was a music teacher. Her school district had to let her go because of budget cuts. Morgan packed up everything and moved to Chicago. She was going to see Bryan face to face and no one was going to stop her! When she got to Bryan's office, his sectary said that he was busy and told her to make an appointment. Morgan barged into a conference room, and asked to see Bryan. This handsome, tall man that she had never seen before said I am Bryan. Before she could retreat, her water broke, and her contractions were painful, keeping her rooted to where she stood. He picked her up and took her to his office and laid her on his couch. When she was in the office she saw a picture of the person she knew as Bryan, with the man that just said he was Bryan. She pointed and said that is Bryan, I want to see him now. Bryan said that is my brother Dillon, and I'm afraid you can't see him. Dillon died 6 months ago. Dillon would often take trips and use his brother's name, and his credit cards, leaving Bryan to clean up his mess. The ambulance came, and Bryan asked Morgan who he could call for her. She said no body.  Morgan was an only child, and both of her parents had died the month before Morgan took her trip to Aruba. The Cailborn family was very wealthy, so everyone thought Morgan was there as a gold digger. In truth she was there because she wanted her son to know his family. This story really touched my heart. When everyone finally trusted Morgan to be who she really was, everyone loved and accepted her. I loved it the first time she met Bryan's parents. There were tears shed. They really wanted to be grandparents to Brice. I couldn't put this book down until I was finished with it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",positive,book

9769,"I was familiar with the Lovecraft from the Call of Cthulhu RPG, but had never actually read any of the stories.Purchase of my Kindle led me to pick this up.  What a great deal for $2!The writing is amazing.  The ideas that Lovecraft either came up with or built upon are wonderful.  His Mythos is complicated and engaging.Lovecraft does a good job of referencing some earlier stories.  It's nice to hear about the Innsmouth Curse, for example, in multiple stories.  Though, you might get sick of hearing of the Mad Arab who wrote the Necronomican.  Seriously, was Mad part of his name?This collection, in my opinion, is front-loaded with the best stuff.  My favorites being The Call of Cthulhu, The Dunwich Horror and The Shadow over Innsmouth.  Though, the Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath is really good also.Now, be warned, this was written in a time when different language was acceptable.  Some of what he says is quite offensive, but, I hope readers can get past that to the true quality that is there.Easy 5 stars.Edit - I see that a rival publisher doesn't like this review, as all of the reviews here were down-voted after I pointed out this was the better version.

I am a French speaking person and I was more into the dictionary than the book itself.  But I loved it, it expend my vocabulary to the max.  Naturally, as a French speaking person, I sometime found it confusing; was it the language barrier or was it really difficult to follow.  So, I was glad when I read some reviewers saying it was confusing and all over the place for them too.  But I still appreciate this book tremendously.The book cover is very representative to the storyline.  This story has strong characters who bring interesting plots to the storylines with issues such as homelessness, sexual abuse, rape, torture, special abilities and paranormal; a story that is so unpredictable.This is a book/storyline where you need and open mind, this is not an easy read.  You need to go back few pages in order to catch the idea, the meaning of what you just read.  Even if the storyline is about Jesse and Sarah who are about 17 years old, this is adult material.  Is this reality or hallucination?  Is this reality or parallel planes?  I really enjoyed this book and I would tremendously enjoy a sequel.I just downloaded &#8220;Corvus&#8221; of the same author.

8334,"H. Beam Piper didn't invent the parallel universes concept, but he did more than almost anyone else to popularize it.Piper's Paratime is an infinite band of parallel Earths, each splitting off as the result of a decision somewhere in history. The resulting levels range from uninhabited Earths to Earths with high space-faring civilizations. And one of those Earths discovered how to travel between these worlds.Of course a paratime traveling civilization opens the possibility of all sorts of mischief and requires a police force. Since the Original Time Line has exhausted its resources, it needs paratime travel to obtain the resources it requires to continue to exist. It's the job of the Paratime Police to keep order among the paratimers and to keep the Paratime Secret at all costs.These stories are built around the career of Verkan Val, paratime policeman extraordinary, and his efforts to help his culture keep the Paratime Secret. It's not an easy job. In the course of these stories Val has to recover a Venusian Night Hound that has been let loose on our timeline (late-40's Pennsylvania to be exact), get his sometime-wife Dalla off a world where reincarnation is scientifically proven fact before she overturns the entire civilization, and battle a gang of trans time slavers whose roots reach into the very heart of the Original Time Line government itself.Most of these stories originally appeared in Astounding Science Fiction in the late 40s and 50s. Like most Astounding offerings, they're full of high action against well-thought-out backgrounds and spiced with interesting characters. It makes for a colorful offering.Although Piper had been writing science fiction for more than 15 years, he didn't attract real notice until his last Paratime story, Lord Kalvin of Otherwhen, and the unrelated Little Fuzzy. Unfortunately, depressed by financial troubles, he committed suicide just as his career was taking off. It's good to have this collection to help remember H. Beam Piper at his best.",positive,book
1695,"This book was inspired by the true story of Alexander Selkirk, who survived alone for almost five years on an uninhabited island off the coast of Chile.It is a very interesting story with a lot of imagination by Verne as it is written in the later 1800s. It starts in 1865, March, Richmond, VA. The capital of the Confederacy is under siege by the Union Army under Lt. Gen. U. S. Grant.Five men, Cyrus, Pencroft, Herbert, Neb and Gideon, and a dog named Top are trapped in Richmond and wish to escape from the town. The weather is bad, but there is a balloon tethered in the middle of town, and the storm seems to provide some cover as the Confederates are less attentive with the storm. They get into the balloon with a dog and set off on an adventure. They are blown west by the storm, and end up over the ocean, with the balloon losing altitude, when they very fortunately to crash on a tropical island, which turns out to be volcanic and large enough to have a variety on the island.Interesting that Verne uses a balloon which is only coming into use, as the device to get his folks onto the deserted tropical island.The five men are a good collection of skills and personalities and work well together. Captain Cyrus is their knowledgeable and inspiring leader with an engineer's practical knowledge. Pencroft, is a practical and hardworking sailor. Gideon is kind of a ""everyman"" -- observant, strong and resourceful and loving. Herbert a young, man learning and becoming a naturalist. It is a well done book where the whole crew works hard to make a life for themselves on the island using what is available. They do an excellent job using what is at hand, and make chemicals including nitroglycerine, using what is on the island.A well done and interesting adventure tale. Hard to always appreciate that it was written in 1870, as it has aged well.  An enjoyable Verne adventure novel, certainly one of his best.",positive,book

7544,"It's the morning after and Jane Porter is definitely feeling much lighter hearted after a night in the arms - and bed of Antonio Villareal.  He's everything she could have hoped for in a Master.  It's just too bad their sexual relationship will only last through the weekend, and then it's back to her safe, staid existence. Or so she thinks.Antonio Villareal is every inch a Master.  His sexual exploits are legendary and Jane can attest that he's definitely a wonderful lover.  Only she hasn't fully experienced everything he's got to offer because he hasn't introduced her to his best friend Santos yet.  Antonio and Santos enjoy sharing a woman and Jane's about to experience being mastered by not one but two men.Jane and her best friend and business partner, Lily's company R.S.V.P. is responsible for setting up the events this weekend. However, it's their extracurricular activities that are holding their attention.  Jane's caught up in her sexual encounter with Antonio and the new knowledge that he shares women with his best friend Santos.  She has to admit that it's a fantasy she enjoys but never seriously considered being in such a situation herself - until cornered by Antonio and Santos.Her friend Lily had her own sexual experience but her emotions are in a tizzy over the event.  Lily and Jean Jacques are strong minded individuals and he's definitely a Dominant male so the simple fact that she won't accept his dominance over her is going to cause all sorts of problems.  Jealousy, hurt, and a power struggle are at the forefront of their relationship.  Can they get past their need for control and admit to their feelings?I've reached the conclusion that Dominique Adair is a cruel woman - or maybe she just enjoys teasing us - in either case, she's definitely got me hooked with her JANE PORTER stories!  These stories capture your attention from the very beginning, build your anticipation, engage your emotions - and then you discover that you'll have to wait for the next story to find out what happens next - and believe me, you'll want to know what happens next.  These characters are highly memorable, the sex scenes are beyond hot and conversations are delightfully wicked.  I've got a real fondness for Jane, Antonio and Santos, but I have to confess it's Lily and Jean Jacques battle of wills that really holds my attention and makes `angry sex' so very appealing.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",positive,book

There are so many &#34;this is absurd&#34; twists that this book takes which are dealt with brilliantly by author Chase that you actually believe that this stuff can happen, especially today.  You will not forget these characters, including Kasey's devoted seducer and eventually lover, Gram, and you will run right out and get its sequel, High Line, featuring Garrett, as soon as you finish this full court press.",positive,book

6150,"After reading the Out of the Box series I just HAD to learn what the story was with Brett, Leo and Lisa. They're appearance in those stories had piqued my interest.The club On The Edge was only 3 months old but it had been an instant success with the people of Haventown. Both human and vampire alike. It's success was so great that it's owner Brett had to hire more help. After a hard day of interviews he was ready for a quiet night at home. Instead he found himself in whole different, but much more pleasing situation.Though short I loved reading this. Number one, the whole idea of vampires and humans mingling and having fun on the dance floor and in the dark alcoves makes me shiver. It makes me want to put on my dancing shoes and a slinky dress! The second thing that made this a hit for me was how easy it was for me to slip into the story.

A bit darker (what's not to love?), but just as lightly humorous with an interesting cast of fantasy characters living side by side with humans. No spoilers here - go buy the books yourself (make Tuttle some money, ok? He needs to buy more depilatory) and plan to read them all, one after the other.

Shawn has been in love with Alex for years, but out of respect for their friendship and working environment, he never revealed his feelings.  Their undercover assignment was fate telling him this was meant to be, and Shawn took full advantage of the opportunity to finally show Alex how much he loved him.Alex never thought of himself as gay and had even less of a clue that Shawn might be gay. This was an assignment and you did whatever was needed to survive.  The fact that he actually liked kissing Shawn and his body came alive every time Shawn touched him only made their undercover identities more believable.  Once the sting was over and they made their case, things would go back to normal, so Alex believed.A Matter of Necessity was a romantic comedy with added suspense and drama.  Shawn was a lovesick puppy who drove Alex absolutely batty and I loved every minute of it.  Who wouldn't want this gorgeous g-man with a sexy Australian accent declaring to anyone who would listen how much he loves you?  Alex wanted to believe he didn't want Shawn, but he knew he would be lying.  He wanted Shawn just as much as Shawn wanted him, but Alex was afraid of the stigma of being gay.  I did feel for Alex and his struggle to come to terms with his attraction to another man, and Shawn's sweet, lovingly aggressive pursuit of him only added to his struggle.  Even though Shawn and Alex took a while to see eye to eye about their relationship, they never lost respect for one another as teammates or their fierce protectiveness of each other.  The reactions of their other teammates from the Bureau to their relationship was a mixed bag, with some reactions fitting perfectly to the comedic tone of the story.

After visiting her shop with Simon to make a delivery he knows she is his mate and Curana to his Alpha. Max has to let Emma know what he is (a puma shifter) as well as who he is (the Alpha leader of the Pride) and he's concerned that she may not be strong enough to be the Curana to his Alpha and the leader of the women of his Pride.Emma is a huge surprise to all who meet her, she's no pushover to Max and can hold her own with any of the other women. She's even able to teach them a lesson or two. The wise cracks and kitty jokes never stop!This is fun, witty, hilarious and entertaining.  Read the series, I am!",positive,book
9894,"Tuttle does an excellent job of creating a fantasy world and tweaking the archetypes of the different types of stock fantasy characters.  Seeing the world evolve and develop during the course of his various books is a pleasure.  This particular book is darker than the other Markhat stories, although it does retain the element of humor that is more prominent in the other Markhat stories.  If you enjoy Terry Pratchett (think Vimes and not Rincewind), then you will enjoy Tuttle's books.  But read them in order, especially if you have a Kindle since the stories are only $0.99 apiece (I feel guilty - I want to at least take Tuttle out and buy him a couple of beers since I bought his entire library for only $8).

2970,"I liked this book, even if the begnning did drag. The emails, in the end, helped build the relationship between them. Kelly and Jae knew each other better than they thought they did thanks to those emails, otherwise I would be saying the sex and &#34; love you's&#34; came too fast. Something that was pointed out in another review was that Kelly took advantage of Will's past. Yes, Will was abused but Kelly didn't know about it until after sex had pretty much stopped between them. Also, Will mentioned wanting someone to &#34;save&#34; him, and maybe Will saw Kelly as that person and found comfort and not resentment in the nature of the relationship.I would have liked to see more of Jae's family, just for te humor of all of the angry Asian women he talked about... would have lightened up the book some. It had its angst, but nothing I felt was overplayed. The feelings were organic.I did become slightly... fed up with the on-again off-agin part. One thing would arise and one of them would run off, and a few weeks later they were together again... maybe three or four times. It got a little old.I did enjoy the humor of the book, though Will's title as &#34;all around slut&#34; was a little too raw.The characters were all ther own, and I absolutely loved Will. Would love to see a sequal involvng his father and Kevin.",positive,book

5420,"Helena McAllister is shocked when a handsome man shows up at her door claiming she is the One. Despite her attraction to him, there's no denying that he's insane!  Alex Faustin is far from crazy.  He's a vampire who's just traveled all the way from his luxurious NYC life to the wilds of Colorado for his mate.  It's a race against time to convince her to be his forever, while finding shelter and evading the law.  When a horrible incident reveals his secret, Helena learns he is a creature of darkness.How will she reconcile her feelings for a man who is monster?Admittedly, I had mixed feelings about Called by Blood.  I was not sure if I liked Helena and Alex because they sometimes came off as immature in their reactions and interactions to various situations they were forced to overcome and deal with.  It's been noted that love often makes people reckless.  Perhaps it was Helena's emotional baggage and Alex's spoiled haphazard bungling that that kept me off kilter.  I'm not certain.  All I know is that I really became interested in some of the secondary characters that appeared.  *Shrug* It happens sometimes.The writing style was very contemporary which mostly didn't work for me in the narrative along with the large doses of saccharine romance.  Also, the sweetness seemed at odds with the down and dirty sex.  Overall, it was a pretty decent novel, with harrowing moments and plot twists that kept me reading.  The best compliment I can offer is that I'm willing to reread this story again.  There are a lot of things about it to like and in all fairness, I've been reading lots of vampire fiction back to back, so my expectations differ from book to book.  I'm rather biased against treating vampires in the traditional manner and really get into books where vampirism `evolves' beyond the usual limitations.  This may have colored my initial response to Alex and the hardships he faces with Helena.  Still, I'm also the first to admit that it was used constructively as an effective plot device, and that's worth a bright gold star instead of a wooden stake.Patrice F.",positive,book

3506,"Belinda `Belle' Campbell has had more than her fair share of pain - both mentally and physically.  She's been practically ostracized by many of the members of the Halle pride and injured severely enough to require a steel pin in her leg - which means that she can't shapeshift until they're removed.  The last thing she needs is more complications but that's exactly what she gets in the form of an Alpha wolf named Rick Lowell.Rick Lowell is the Alpha of the Red Wolf Poconos Pack.  He isn't exactly having an easy go of things here lately.  He's been shot, killed a rogue, found his mate, learned of her injuries, and now been told that he cannot take her home.  Why? Because she's Puma and the Wolf pack has to be prepared to accept a non-Wolf Luna.  He could handle all that but throw in an uppity dominant female looking to take over as Luna and things are bound to get very interesting.Belle has no doubt that Rick is her mate but she's not a push over and he's a little too full of himself for her taste.  Besides her doctors are in Halle and therefore she'll be staying put for the time being - possibly until the pin in her leg can be removed.  Rick's not willing to wait that long though, once the cast comes off he wants her with him - and it will still be another six months before she'll be able to shift.Belle's all for starting her life at Rick's side but she's not at all ready to take on Gina and her demands for full protocol.  Fortunately Belle isn't afraid to fight for what's hers and if that means taking on one conniving bitch then she'll use every means at her disposal to ensure that she comes out on top.  Rick is aware of just how devious Gina is and he's willing to take whatever steps necessary to ensure that Belle's transition into the pack is as smooth as possible and that she be allowed to recuperate before facing Gina and her challenge.  He shouldn't have worried.  Even being unable to shift, Belle is more than capable of facing down Gina and she does it with such style that you'll be left with no doubt that this `cat' is far superior to the `dog.'  Belle's the perfect match for Rick, but what will happen when Gina's plans push Rick and Belle into making decisions that could have disastrous results?Just when I thought the HALLE PUMA series couldn't get any better, it does!  STEEL BEAUTY is the fourth book in this delightful series and revisiting these characters is a pleasure you won't want to pass up.  This story is infused with humor, some real kick butt action, a memorable romance and proof that cats and dogs can be friends - and so much more. Belle won me over with her `in your face' attitude and the hilarious way she taunts Gina - as well as Rick.  She's not a gal who's going to let anyone get away with anything and I adore that about her.  Rick is exactly the sort of man Belle needs, he's just got to learn to share problems and worries - and she is chock full of ways of ensuring that he doesn't forget that she is his life partner.If you haven't read the other titles in this series, I'd highly recommend doing so - not because it's necessary to understand this book but because they're delightfully fun.

6093,"I read this because someone recommended it to me, and it was a cute read.  Other reviewers have already summed up the book, so I won't go into that.  I'd say the author's biggest strength is her humor.  I'll give an example.  The hero had the heroine in a bath (she wasn't feeling well at the time so he was trying to bring down her fever), and she asked, ""What am I doing here and why do I keep touching your lovely chest?"" It was the last part that had me laughing out loud.  Even as I think of it now, I'm laughing.This is a good book for people who like women disguised as men stories where the women are strong and fully capable of taking care of themselves.  The heroine was no wimpering female, and the hero was lovable too.One thing I don't understand is why this was tagged as a Christian romance.  If you're familiar with the traditional market for Christian romances, this is not tame enough to be termed Christian.  There's stuff in here that would be deemed offensive.  Though the hero and heroine never went all the way, they did go pretty far, and since Christian romances don't go beyond the kiss and some readers thinking necking is ""lustful"", I don't know if I'd recommend this book to women who are uncomfortable with nudity and touching body parts that are usually covered.  (For me, this is not a problem, but since I've seen some reviews by women who expected a very clean Christian romance and got upset with ""necking"", they won't like this book.  But if you like a little more realism in your book, then I say go for it!)Like I said, I have no problems with this book.  It was fun and light and perfect for a nice beach read.",positive,book

2108,"I really enjoyed this second installment in this series.  I just wish it had been longer.  I would also say that I liked the fact that this one, unlike the first, had chapter demarcations, even though it's short.  Chapter demarcations make it so much easier to see how close you are to the end of a chapter or to find a stopping place when you need to do so, although that's not much of a problem on short novellas.  The characters in this series so far are very realistic in my opinion.  I think this book had just the right amount of ""bits of everything"", except being so short.  I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that.  If you liked the first book in the series, I think you'll like this one.  Give it a shot because I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Have at it!  I can't wait to read the third and final one.",positive,book

2178,"When I was 13 and haunting the public library one summer, I discovered Zane Grey western novels. The very first one I read was East of the Pecos, and it thrilled me. It had action and adventure, horses which I loved, and told of an Old West where men were men and women were glad of it. The novels had a strong romance subplot -- at least strong according to my newly-minted teen-hood.That one book had me scouring the section where his books were shelved. I can't remember how many I read. Each thrilled me as much as that first one.When I bought my Kindle a couple of years ago, I spent days scrolling through the lists of free books and low-priced ebooks. Imagine my delight when I came across this little gem -- a collection of 26 of Zane Grey's most popular novels and with a Linked Table of Contents. I grabbed it, and started reading.I have to admit that I was totally surprised that the stories still captivated me. I'd thought I might find them as stale as an episode of Gunsmoke on TV Land. Not at all. The stories are still compelling plus I love the American West history in each.After I'd read the first book in this collection, I visited the Texas Ranger Museum in Waco, Texas. Walking through the museum, I realized how accurate were Grey's portrayals of the men who brought law to Texas and to the history of nineteenth century America.This collection is wonderful, and it's worth far more than the modest price. The books are delightful in every way and make one understand why the western was so popular in television and movies for so long.",positive,book

When she is on the dance floor she turns around and runs into a face that she left behind years ago - Eamon Blake, an Irish devil she had a three month fling with while in Ireland for the summer.  Their sexual chemistry remains just as strong and Caitlin is happy to bring Eamon home with her for a bit of naughtiness.

Aislinn learns that being a knight means putting the Kingdom in front of personal concerns and helping those that cannot help themselves. In a journey is fraught with danger and filled with adventure, Aislinn is forced to grow up fast. She must stay strong and develop the skills necessary to realize her lifelong dream.With sword fights, passionate love, mythical creatures, and courtly games, Woman of Honor is my kind of book. I love the idea of incorporating real history in fantasy, and Ms. Zoltack's book is based on the real life story of a group of female knights. Blending history with fiction, her writing is full of plot and adventure and her characters are strong and believable. Most of all, I grew to love all of them and cared about their hardships and successes.Aislinn is quite the main protagonist. She's tenacious and bold, beautiful and strong. The romance that blooms between her and the prince is well developed after years of solid friendship and teasing. I enjoyed reading about their secret courtship and had no idea how their romance would turn out! Ms. Zoltack has a few twists in store that will shock and startle as well as please.In conclusion, I thoroughly recommend this book for everyone that enjoys fantasy, romance and adventure!

3888,"London, 1840`Wicked' Wade Warrick doesn't deserve the rake reputation he has - he's simply being judged by his brothers' unruly behavior.  All he has to do is dance with a woman once and rumors begin flying fast and furious all over the ton.  No father would allow him within touching distance of a virginal daughter which is why it's stunning when he leaves a crowded ballroom only to find the engaged reigning beauty of the haute ton awaiting him in his carriage.Lady Helen Richmond, daughter of the Earl of Charbeau, is on a mission.  Her father has betrothed her to a man not of her choosing and refuses to listen to her objections to the match.  She's taking matters into her own hands and has decided to proposition `Wicked Warrick.'  She has no doubt that the arrogant Duke of Resdale will no longer want her if she's ruined and she's sincerely counting on Wade to come to the rescue in her time of need.Wade isn't one for indiscriminate sex and he certainly isn't comfortable deflowering a virgin.  He believes that one should feel something for a woman besides lust before taking her to his bed.  Helen's proposition is shocking - and oddly enough she isn't expecting marriage and in fact insists that she'd like to keep their association a secret.  Helen's put a lot of thought into her decision to approach Wade and the simple fact that he's never shown any interest in her is a huge plus.  If he'd been one of her many admirers then their `association' would result in being forced to marry and that holds no appeal to her.After much discussion, Wade realizes that he is attracted to Helen and saying no to her is practically impossible.  Helen is stunned that Wade requires so much convincing - after all wouldn't a rake be overjoyed at the idea of sex without any expectations?  Fortunately, Wade does agree to bed her and the experience is better than Helen ever dared to hope.Now that Helen's been `ruined' she's safe from the unwanted marriage but now she's craving more time with Wade.  She knows that there's no possibility of anything more permanent with Wade but there's nothing wrong with a few stolen moments - or hours, is there?  Wade's assured her that he's not a rake but surely a man so skilled in bed has been with more women than he's letting on.  Things get a little more complicated when she begins experiencing signs of pregnancy - and there's the attack on Wade.  Wade and Helen are sure that her ex-fianc&eacute; is behind the incident but can they prove it?Emma Wildes' historicals are always a pleasure to read.  The characters are strong and brilliantly depicted so that readers are quickly caught up in their plights.  CAN'T SAY NO is the third book in THE IMPROPER LADIES series and it's a fabulous addition to Ms. Wildes' booklist.  Helen's determination to be `ruined' and Wade's disbelief at her plea drew me into the storyline but it's the passion and desire between them that kept me enchanted by their story.  In addition there's plenty of mystery, laughter, joy and even a few tears that make CAN'T SAY NO a title you won't want to miss.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",positive,book

10235,"(Spoiler Alert) Ten years ago the h caught the H in bed with her best friend.  Because of this, the h leaves town and starts a singing career.  After becoming a huge success as a country singer, she returns to her home town and comes face to face with the H and his daughter.  They greet each other and act as though they were good friend separated by distance and time, not a huge betrayal.  As a reader you rationalize that the child was there and so were other people so maybe that was why the lack of emotion but this same lack of anger continues throughout the book.  When they meet again, the H informs the h that he had actually ended up marrying the OW but she died a few years back.  The h then cries about what an awful friend she was for not being there for her best friend and how sorry she was that she was dead and unable to apologize to her for all the hurtful things that she had said to her.  WHAT?!!!  So...the best friend sleeps with the H and the h is apologizing?The story continues pretty much with the same tone.  IMO, the H did nothing to win the h back or to build trust again, it just happens as though it was a given: the h will take the H back.  The reconciliation was too easy and the H was completely unimpressive.  All his actions spoke of a man with little passion or action.  For example, the h sees him in bed with her best friend but he won't go after her because he believes she should go.  He thought that the OW might have been lying about the paternity of the baby after they had sex but he marries her anyway.  The OW had a miscarriage, the reason he married her, but he stays married.  This H sucks!Worse of all, the entire story they kept talking about the OW as though she was not a huge source of betrayal among them.  Things like ""your house is beautiful, she must have really loved it"" and while skating mentioning how the OW went skating with the daughter all the time or what a wonderful mother the OW was.The comment that the h said to the H mom towards the end of the book pretty much sums up the book : ""I should have stayed and fought for him.""  Really?  Because in my book I would fight to get rid of a man who would sleep with my best friend, made no effort to make amends and then complained about how hard HIS life was because everyone knew he cheated on her.  I have read brilliantly written stories about reconciliations before; this one is simply not one of them.",negative,book

One minute she was a vixen and the next a victim running from a werewolf through the woods. Justina's ex being a werewolf was a totally random an unecessary plot twist.

Now all that is true, but I was really expecting a recipe where it WAS a vegetarian version not just --- well, use vegetarian ingredients instead of what this recipe says.

6937,"This book and I just didn't get along. I hate the title. Russian Bear for a m/m BDSM novel doesn't seem well thought out. Neither was the rest of the book.This book was neither a romance nor erotica but porn. For me the difference is in an emotional connection between the characters. If i don't like the characters but am just reading about them getting their rocks off and the story sucks it's porn. That's what this was. mild spoilers ahead.Mischa- the dom- seems like a tool. He's either 'smug' 'self-satisfied' or 'looking pleased with himself' in every scene. usually after hurting Tom.And then there is poor Tom who decides he might like to try out some bdsm so guess what his first 'scene' is? CBT! Really? There was no build-up, no connection and the scenes were just vaguely unpleasant. I'm not sure how squeezing some guy's nuts until he cries is actually BDSM as all the rest of it (ritual, trust, an exchange, etc.) was all missing.From a writing standpoint, the POV switches were a nightmare and as another reviewer commented it's hard to tell who is speaking, acting or thinking because there are no paragraph breaks or appropriate spacing. This is not a formatting issue but something the writer didn't do properly. It was sloppy.And there were ridiculous lines in there. Not cheesy dialogue during sex lines which is to be expected but almost ignorant or poorly thought out sentences. For example, there was a sentence that said something like, 'mischa was thinking hard. and when he did that he usually made a lot of money.' What?I had no idea what these people looked like, they were shallow as all get out and I didn't even want to be a fly on the wall while they had sex which is a shame. Their first two 'scenes' are just Mischa telling Tom to bend over and take it. That's not BDSM, it's gay sex.Some authors like Cherise Sinclair or Alexis Snow/Davitt even Anna Martin's Another Way give the impression that the author knows what they are writing about because they've lived it or done great research and have a good imagination. this read more like someone's purient fantasy.Anyway, I'm sorry to say that I really hated this book and have no idea why it has so many good reviews.

As such, I could not feel any connection to the characters and soon lost interest.  Another thing that I found highly annoying was that some of the characters dialogue was in French.

I'll sneak vampires into my dorm room despite the fact that they eat humans and I totally live with a bunch of humans!  I'll make out with my fairy-boy and then I'll make out with my vampire-boy.  There's a whole fairy society and stuff, but that doesn't matter, because I make my own rules!  Rules are for losers who aren't very important fairies.Did I mention that I'm beautiful and I have tons of powers that nobody else has and I am in love with a fairy AND a vampire?  In case you didn't get it, I'll refer to my fairy-boy and my vampire-boy a few more times.  Check out the sequels where I'm sure to break some more rules, uncover more unprecedented powers that only I have, and be with two guys while I try to figure out which one of them I really want - the fairy-boy I have an inexplicable, instant, and powerful bond with or the vampire-boy I have an inexplicable, instant, and powerful bond with!",negative,book

4296,"I'm fascinated with all things Titanic.  I really wanted to like this book, but I couldn't.For the one thing, I think the book needed a good editor.  Even better, spell check.  There were obvious typos that running spell check would have caught.  There were parts of the book inserted into other parts that made no sense. For example, when the main character was on the bridge, talking to the captain, there's suddenly a dialogue of several paragraphs long with a female character, when the two men were the only ones in the map room.  For another, the characters were hard to tell apart.  They're introduced by name, dropped in with little to no description, and none of them stood out for me. I can't even remember the names and I just finished reading less than an hour ago.I scrapbook. I take my family photos and put them on a page with elements and journaling that tell the story of what happened on that particular occasion.  I don't always scrapbook all the photos from a given day at the same time. I might return to it months later.  The first time I had my finished product printed, I discovered that I often told the same story page after page, because I didn't create them at the same time.  I've learned, before printing, to check for duplication, flow and continuity. This book didn't have that.  We were told the same things over and over, often a few paragraphs apart.  We were told thing in dialogue rather than shown them in description.I didn't ""feel"" like I was there. I didn't care for the characters.

1669,"I was frustrated with this book. I really love Dohner's New Species series, but I'll have to say that I'm not going to be reading anymore about Zorn Warriors.I can respect Dohner's ability to create dynamic cultures in her books. I read Ral's Woman and decided to give Kidnapping Casey a try, but I honestly wish I didn't. I don't like the culture of Zorn (I can respect Dohner's ability to create it, but it doesn't mean that I necessarily like it). I get that its an Alpha Male borderline D/s world, but the way that Argernon and Casey's relationship played out just wasn't cool for me.I'll have to agree with other reviewers here that rape = rape, yes, even if your rapist brings you to orgasm. I thought it was sweet that Argernon cared about Casey so much. I get that she's a gamechanger for him. I don't like that he tied her up (twice) and after she repeatedly says no (twice), they still end up doing the deed and Casey's all right with it. Oh, and he ties her up afterwards, because he doesn't trust her. And keeps her tied up for days, even making her wear a chastity belt so she can't please herself, and parades around in front of her trying to make her want him. Seems like the Zorn guys are no better than their pointy-eared counterparts, the Collis. I did not like Argernon, because he never learns that it is not ok to kidnap and rape someone. Its not ok to replace 3 girls last minute and expect your new girl to accept you. And Casey just seemed like a silent victim. I felt sorry for her. Somebody said that she was strong and could hold her own... silent strength and holding on to her pain? Yea.I felt like maybe I would've liked this book better if it was drawn out a bit more. Like, I would've liked to see Casey go to Berrr and get unbounded. Then she could've dated and get Argernon to win her love. But whatever. This book is what it is. This is the end of the Zorn for me. I will continue to read about Dohner's New Species and Cyborgs, but I'm not interested in Rever or Berrr.",negative,book

I counted that adjective at least 8 times.Her ex-husband is painted as evil, and he is sterotypically and unbelievable so. Kelly is rarely brave, mostly self pitying and spends more time worrying about her possible future relationship with a man than with her child. How sad, that she goes home from work everyday and takes care of her child. I thought that was what parenting was.She is rescued by the teacher, and his FBI friends, how convenient. He fell in love with her when he met her, having just been ditched by his platonic girlfriend of several years.

Historical documents prove that he did whatever he could to save them. His dilemma was how does he speak out without further endangering the Jews. He went to the edge of risk and he saved hundreds of thousands of Jewish people. Many he kept hidden in the Vatican and others were hidden in convents and monasteries.

3454,"SPOILERS IN THE REVIEWI actually think that reviewer Lasha described perfectly what I think about this book, but instead of just commenting on her review I decided to make it my own review because this book is a perfect example of why I think GFY trope could be so very offensive in my opinion. I think it can be beatifully and sensibly done too, just not in this book in my opinion. I was ready to scream more than once when I was reading it indeed and not just about who pitches and who catches. I was ready to scream when author made her characters say over and over AND OVER again how they do not want to do REALLY gay stuff, whatever that meant for them in any given moment. Or when one of the characters when they are getting ready to pose for the calendar and watch gay couple posing says that he is relieved that heavy duty gay action was over.Guess what you dolts? No matter how many times it is stressed that other naked guys do not turn you on you ARE gays or bisexual. If you are a gay guy it is my impression that maybe a person whom you are not attracted to does not have to turn you on, just as every guy does not have to turn me on as straight woman.Oh let's not forget the ""he has gay friends"" thing and how those gay friends according to one of them are TWINKS which is translated as effeminate men with swimmer physique, contrary to what our characters are.Oh I can go on and on.

Allow me to give you some background: The heroine is married to an abusive husband who has lots of money and runs the town due to his control of the logging business there. She has one great kid and one delinquent and she is beaten down by her hubby and shows more annoyance than concern for her kids who obviously are dealing with their dysfunctioanl family in their own ways but need help. She takes crap from her husband, her kids, and pretty much everyone. The hero works for an environmental agency and sees the man's wife and smiles at her after which they go to infatuation and love.OK, if she is so terrified of her husband and doesn't have the nerve to leave him, where is she getting the nerve to have an affair on him in front of the whole gossiping town (her tramp friend takes her to dinner and they are seen by everyone eatting with the hero and his coworker)? Honestly, I'm not one for infidelity, even if she is cheating on her abusive/cheating husband - LEAVE HIM. I get that he is this controlling powerful guy, but if she is afraid to leave him, what does she think he'll do if she is cheating on him? This was compared to Bridges of Madison County, but it is not anywhere near as good as that - it may be about infidelity, but it does not have the same intensity - it's just not written as well.

I did like the character Flora, but the other characters were just plain boring.  There was supposed to be some big ""twist"" to the ending, but I had it figured out way before the end.

7869,"Contains some spoilers...This story rates between a 1 and a 1.5. It was very unique...but in an peculiar way. It was kind of like Twilight meets I Am Legend.If you do not like the YA genre, then this is not the book for you. With that said, I am not a fan of the YA so I struggled reading this book. The premise of the story seems a bit too immature for an adult audience. Starla and her friend Jordan become vampires so that they can be wealthy and glamorous but the story opens with the two friends standing outside of Jordan former childhood home; now kicked out and homeless because of her new vampiric state. The two Blood Sisters resign themselves to their new status and go looking for their first ""meal"" as vampires. They stumble upon a house with a former classmate who was reviled by Jordan because he used her sexually and then threw her away. A midnight snack and revenge at the same time...two birds, one stone. Perfect, right? Wrong, the girls' effort is thwarted by a usurper. He stole their meal and drained their first meal dry...taking away the opportunity for a meal and revenge. Darn!Poor girls...now, what are they gonna do, it's not like they can pick up blood in aisle thirteen at their local grocer. Nope, they have to figure out another food source. They continue their hunting and wind up at a local nightclub. They target a young girl, a doppelg&auml;nger for Starla according to Jordan, as their victim. The girls have their first food fight, literally, as the battle over who will win the quarry. Their first attempt of food acquiry ends in an epic failure. Their young victim escapes them while they are fighting each other over who gets to draw first blood. Starla's ""twin"" runs back into the club shrieking and the girls end up hungry...still.Pitiful humans turned into pathetic vampires...not a pretty picture at all. After their failed attempt to secure food, the girls find themselves at the playground where they were turned into vampires. Their arrival at the playground commences a sequence of events that change their vampiric lives forever.I say that this book reminds me of I am Legend because the vampires were described as completely hairless (even the females) with a gray skintone.The story struck me as disjointed. I could see where the pieces were supposed to connect but they were done so haphazardly. It was as if puzzle pieces of the story were dumped on the floor and the reader had to put the picture together. Mystery or suspense novel provide the reader with pieces or clues so that they can put together the final picture to figure outwho done it, why'd they do it, or what happened. However, since this book fit into neither genre it was not a particularly enjoyable experience piecing together the why's and what's of the story.The characters were just too juvenille to have broader appeal to an adult audience. The primary character ages were about sixteen or seventeen. Starla and Jordan were very scatterbrained (per impulsive descision to become a vampire without thinking through the ramifications); shallow (Starla vandalized and robbed a store to get a leather coat, boots, and sunglasses); and whiny (Starla didn't want to drink blood which made her weak...human...but raged and moaned when someone refered to her as such). Such a spastic trichotomy.Then there was the whole storyline of Mercer's grandfather being able to purify Starla's blood since she hadn't drank human blood. They were going to perform a dialysis of sorts and remove her blood, purify it, and put it back into her body and voila the vampire demon would be excised from her body turning her into a half-human, like Mercer. Dialysis...hmmm...really?!?! The description of the entire process was just too pedestrian. The story definately could have been made more if that storyline and process had been fleshed out a bit more.My feelings on the book are neutral; I did not totally hate it but, most likely, will not read it again. The book began with automatic strike for me because it was a YA which I do not typically read. However, in spite of my non-YA book policy, I have read one or two others and actually enjoyed them because they appealed to me on an intellectual level. The stories were mature in a way that elminiated the teen fiction novel feel. Unfortunately, this book was just too teenyboppery for me to really enjoy.",negative,book

That's unrealistic. If this was a story with only humans, that would be like saying the man she became involved with is related to the killer who murdered her brother. You can't tell me she's not going to have some pent up anger and that her lust is going to make her forget all about her grief. Like I said unrealistic.",negative,book

That's what I expected from Serial, but it was very disappointing.  At the beginning, you're plunged into the thoughts of a serial killer who is searching for his next victim.  When he carries out the murder, it's like you're there watching the whole scene.  It's graphic and disgusting.  There's a certain line of decency, and it's been crossed with this book.  I'm very much opposed to graphic violence for the mere sake of shock value.  This book is heavy on that and weak in actual plot structure.  There's nothing going on to make you want to keep reading.

8166,"Okay, I bought In Memory of Greed for my Nook several months back after seeing it become the #1 Top-Rated Political Thriller here on Amazon. It's gotta be good, right?Turns out that was a serious mistake.Boudreau has a fascinating premise in this book--a corporation trying to control the world's seed stocks, an ex-SEAL caught up in the confusion trying to stop it. Unfortunately, the premise is quickly derailed by unlikable, one-note characters and shoddy plotting. Judging by Amazon, this was Boudreau's first effort, and it shows. By the time the book is over, you've completely forgotten about the seed stocks and moved on to a pretty much unconnected plot. If this, and the heavy-handed writing style(never have I seen so many adverbs!) don't ruin the book, the characters will.Mocado, the SEAL and ""hero"" of the story, is a highly-trained superman who never does anything wrong--except when he does something very stupid. This happens with enough frequency that you start wondering why natural selection hasn't weeded this guy out long before the story opens.Roth, the CEO, is a gluttonous, hard-drinking windbag whose chief skill lies in nearly killing himself in his fits of rage. Once again, natural selection.Jenn(no last name), the love interest, whose character really never elicits the kind of sympathy that would make you care whether she lives or dies. There's just not enough depth to her characterization.Keegan, Roth's enforcer, an Irishman whose behavior throughout the novel completely betrays the ""twist"" Boudreau tries to give him at the end.Graves, the politician. Pretty much a carbon copy of Roth, I spent most of the book trying to tell them apart--although Graves is not prone to the fits of rage of the CEO.And Barstow, the female secret agent. She's a good counterpart to Mocado, in that she's a highly trained operative prone to frequent moments of stupidity. She would have made a better love interest than the completely anemic and colorless Jenn, but not by much.I put down the book eight times before finally deciding to finish. Rather than having characters I could sympathize with--half-way through I was hoping for a nuke to eliminate them all and start afresh. To put it bluntly, it was a painful experience, and I'll never trust Amazon's Top-Rated list again. Mr. Boudreau is in serious need of writing classes, and a better editor. His reviewers, on the other hand, are in need of remedial studies in what makes a good political thriller. Try Clancy, Thor, or Baldacci.",negative,book
4167,"I hate to be the first one star review, but maybe if I write this others will have more opinions to go by and get a broader perspective. I can't believe the paper back is 14.99 - Kindle was .99 and I still feel cheated! I really liked the premise, but the actual writing and story line was just ""lacking"", so much. I kept reading hoping it would get better and it just got worse. I really wanted to like it, but. wow, it was bad. Here are a few reasons:- Poor editing, at least on the digital version. I find that truly detracts from any story no matter how good (and more so when it's not so good).- There was suppossed to be this sexual tension and subsequent sense of falling in love between the two characters and it just wasn't there. He avoided her and they barely spoke. Her family treated him horridly (based on his great great grandfather's previous treatment of her), and she basically went along with it. They never really spoke, so where's the love? Even when she believes he's a different person (which happened way too easily), they still never had the actual falling in love - they just were, and then the were in love. Lame.- He lookd like his great great grandfather so much that only the height and build are a bit off and no one notices? Really? People tell me I look just like my mom, and yet, if you were to put us together at the same age, we would look related but not enough to pass for one another. Yet he is practically an exact replica almost how many generations later? Lame. Then it happens again later (won't say how, but really, what are the odds?). Lame.- The use of cliches and colloquialisms in writng, especially narration of a story line, is just poor writing. Characters speaking in them can be justified if it is done to make a point or to embellish a time period, but if it is done repeatedly or anachronistically it just detracts from the story line and weakens the writing. It's also freaking annoying! :)- The end is just......ok, lame. I sense a pattern. So, yeah, if you were to ask me to sum up my review in one word, I guess we know what it would be. I'd go on about the ending, but I don't want to ruin it for anyone who still wants to read it. I do think the ending is just wrong though, and it harkins back to my sentiments about them truly being ""in love"". Well, maybe she was, but him, not so much.If you love time travel romance, the best I've ever read is ""Outlander"" by Diana Gabaldon. An incredible book. An amazing series. It's not .99 cents, but It's worth every penny it costs for digital or hardcover. It's the quintessential time travel romance. Ah, I think I'll go read that series again....",negative,book
7018,"Okay, the best part of this story was the blurb and the book cover. It does a really good job of getting your interest in what promises to be a good read. However, the first thing I noticed was the lack of editing. Many paragraphs had two people talking in them so that you were constantly going back and forth between characters, and trying to make sense of it. The second thing was the hero was a jerk. He treated the heroine like crap. All he wanted was to have sex with her, even when he believed she was his brother's girlfriend. And then he did. What kind of brother does that? A big no no for me is also when the hero sleeps with other women,(implied) even if he and the heroine were on a break. Granted, they were on a break for 6 months but if he cared anything about the girl he wouldn't be jumping into someone else's bed.What irritated me about the heroine is she hates him one minute, and sleeps with him the next. She's wishy washy and her character is weak. You didn't get the feel that there was any real warmth, even real lust developing between them. The sex scenes were luke warm but it was more because of the author's choice of words than the actual act.And yet somehow they fall in love and she finally gets that proposal at the end.

I was a little worried, having read the 2 star review, but I figured the several five star reviews outweighed it.I wish I'd listened to the 2 star reviewer (who I think was a little nicer than she should have been).This book was awful. Horrible. Disgusting. Upsetting. I cannot find a single redeeming factor to the entire thing.  Here's why I hated it, why I'm fired up about reviewing it, and why I will never, ever, never, ever again read anything by this author.- The h is meek, mild, picked on, mistreated - and she just keeps going back for more. Over and over again, people, including the H, are downright cruel to her. I expected there to be some discovery or journey that leads the h to believe that she is worthwhile and has grown from the experiences she's lived through. That never happens. The book ends and she's still feeling sorry for herself and her life is utter crap.- The H is a complete jerk. He never redeems himself, and he never even makes a full effort to redeem himself. He sleeps with his WIFE after sleeping with the h, then repeatedly chooses his wife again and again (a woman who is cruel and insane) over the h. He simply tells the h 'sorry' and she instantly forgives him and the go on their merry way until the wife comes back a few pages later and the H runs to her.- There is very little lead up to the resolution (and it's a half resolution at that). The h ends up with a man, but it feels like she's more ending up with whatever leftovers are there, than that she's getting a HEA.- The h never stands up for herself and in fact, never even addresses some serious betrayals by her best friend/roommate, who told all of her private information to the crazy stalker wife of the H.It sickens me that I paid good money for this book.

9983,"This is the first time I have ever given a book a one star rating but it was terrible, I found myself skipping pages hoping I would finally find a part where it started to improve.  I could not believe this author is supposed to be an established writer as it read as if it was the first attempt by a hopeful teenaged writer.I was left with the impression that the author wanted to make it as ""exciting"" as possible and thus threw in event after event without wasting time on such details as good character development.  Descriptions were horrendous such as ""... she was happy with her cheerleader-like looks and athletic body"" for the description of the main character, Jessica, in the book.There were also jarring word usages that did not fit in with what little characterization we were given.  For example, a policeman who up until this point in the book has spoken in fairly standard English suddenly tells Jessica, ""You might be heroes,"" Patterson frowned, ""but I'm still angry at how you disrespected me.""As a further example of how the dialogue in this book progresses, Patterson then complains about how much paperwork he will have because of Jessica.  Jessica looks out the window and replies ""Sorry. Please don't take it personally.""  There is a lot of that snippiness in the book from the main characters who we are apparently supposed to respect for their tenacity in keeping going when everyone else is going into hysterics and making false accusations.Then there is the fact that perhaps it would have been easier to suspend disbelief and accept such things as the ""coincidence"" that leads Jessica to find out about the job in Salem and the willingness of her parents to allow her to accept a job that she was hired for over the phone without the person hiring her knowing anything about her other than she was an almost 18 year old girl who lived two states away.  Or the fact that once there, Jessica meets two girls who behave questionably and yet almost immediately considers them to be trustworthy friends and thus is willing to go into a cemetary crypt at night with them after knowing them less than one day.  Jessica is repeatedly talked out of calling the police for help when one of the new friends disappears by the other new friend who appears less than stable (to put it mildly.)Yes, Jessica, who repeatedly shows a lack of judgement and whose only growth in the story is a willingness to accept that the supernatural actually is real is the main character of the story.  I was never able to identify with her or any other character in this story.  The only emotions this story caused in me were shock that this was not written by a brand new writer and relief when I reached the end.I do not recommend this book at all.",negative,book
6232,"Orphaned Wiley had a hard life, unceremoniously abandoned as a child and having to cope that she transforms into an ugly hairy unknown creature when she feels very intense emotions. Well, her life was about to become harder when she stumbles across others of her own kind, one of which is a hot prince who happens to be her betrothed!The book starts off well enough and I quite like the author's writing style. The plot in this book is similar to The Charmer, except told from the perspective of Wiley. If so, it would have been expected that there would have been more plot, or additional twist and turns to give life to this novel. Unfortunately, this was not to be, you ocassionally had word for word replication of certain scenes in The Charmer. The major flaw in this book was that it turned out to be a unconcluded short novel and ended with a ""Read The Charmer to find out how it all ends!""WHAT?!?!?!?!You have got to be kidding me! Short story + overlap in plot + no conclusive ending?!?!?!?! Especially when this novel is $2.99, which is more expensive than the other books in the Darkland series!!

9383,"It's been six months but I remember buying this book because I'd seen a semi-positive review on a blog--Dear Author probably--and because a romance of a mixed-race couple in the 1860's Wild West sounded intriguing. Especially since neither character is white.Unfortunately the story didn't live up to its promise.I did like the start of the book, although I did think it somewhat boring. The author spends a lot of time setting the scene and describing the life of a Chinese worker building the railroads for a pittance and the life of a black single woman trying to build a new life and a business for herself and her friend. Bias, racism, sexism, it's all there and prevalent in the vernacular.As if that's not enough to create obstacles to the couple's happiness, there's also their inability to fully understand each other. Quiang speaks but a little English and he and Leah have to communicate through gestures, looks, and touches.There's all this, and what does the author do with it? Nothing. Cullars glosses over all the difficult--and rewarding--steps of a meaningful relationship building and focuses on the paper thin physical attraction instead. There's a brief mention of how Leah and Quiang learn to communicate with the help of a dictionary, but they don't really talk to each other. When they're together they're either taking their clothes of and having sex or putting their clothes on and thinking about having sex. And those sex scenes are bad. There's creaming and there's tumescence, there's orbs and there's the infamous ""her sex"" euphemism.After all that, the story and my rating for it could have been saved had I bought Quiang's interactions with the triad members. I can't really pinpoint my problem with them, but something in the language used left me unconvinced. It wasn't just Wao's refusal to call an erection an erection, it was also how the revelation of the misappropriation was handled. Until then, I had liked Quiang's willingness to engage in shady businesses for quick profit and that both characters had such defined lives outside each other, after it just felt anticlimactic.I didn't want a happily ever after epilogue, I wanted to read how they get there.So what does the book have? Good historical description with nascent characterisations, but without any real character or relationship development, and a whiff of Wild West adventures. It simply wasn't enough for me.",negative,book

The thing that is so unfortunate about this is that the story had so much potential, but I honestly think the author should be ashamed to charge people for this book in it's current format.

Same thing here - it's that bad!  Waste of time, money and space on my Kindle.The really tough question is where to even start when there are so many things just plain wrong.- The writing is so amateurish that you swear that it had to be written by a teenager that really did not have much life experience.- FYI, England is an island- The supposedly Hero is over 300 years old but acts more like a 19 year old kid. (He runs to Mommy and Daddy when he gets upset with the Council and Daddy threatens to kill the entire Council because baby boy is upset.  Mommy calls the Hero at one point to advise him on what he needs to do.)- There are several scenes where the main female character has a run in with some bullies - it would have worked if the scenes were set in either Grade or High school - but College - really?  One scene is where the so call Heroine is accosted by other immature girls that taunt her because of the way she is dressed and the fact that her Mother is gone.Setting - College hallwayTime Frame - right before graduation, also known as ""Crunch Time"" for those that have actually been to collegeAND YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF 20 YEAR OLD WOMEN THAT ACT AND BEHAVE AS TEENAGERS?  ""HUH""?  Even in Sci-Fi, the actions and events have to be plausible!- Typos that could have easily been corrected- A minor character, the heroine's Boss, that hasn't realized that the Heroine hasn't taken off a day in TWO YEARS?- Both the Male and Female protagonists are just too whining - too juvenile to be interesting - more like ""Rebels without a Clue!""- What romance?  Was there suppose to be romance - or just some heavy groping?The above are only a few of the items that made this book so juvenile, boring and a waste of resources.

Graham completely failed to sell me Conner's motivations.

The plot was weak and I found the characters so weak and unendearing that I couldn't even force myself to try to make sense of their silly background story. Chandra, the so-called heroine, was annoying with a capital 'B' and too contradictory.  I like a story with a strong but not militant Black female character and Chandra was no such character.  It was hard to believe that one, let alone two hotties would ever fall for this hot mess.  The only good thing about this book was this author knows how to deliver a good sex scene.  However, with the characters and storyline so lacking; this book was reduced to being on the level of a low-grade porn.  It was a HUGE disappointment.

5990,"I always debate writing a review and scoring a book I don't finish, but to be fair, I ought to say why I didn't like the book.  I usually like McKenna's stories.  This story, however, was just not that good.  The dialogue was a bit unbelievable, the characters  didn't make sense to me.  I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a good, well thought out, well told story.  This just didn't meet any of that criteria for me.We're supposed to believe that Max, as a PI successful enough to hire employees for his PI/security firm, instead of following the subject of his investigation follows instead the teacher of a dance class that he found attractive.  While he follows her we get this constant stream of his inner dialogue, which I didn't find to be very humorous or enlightening.  It was just annoying.Jordan, the subject of Max's stalking, goes to a bar with some students from her dance class.  See's Max, gathers up her courage to hit on him, and then let's him feel her up on the dance floor and promptly takes him to her house.... Really??  Later that night, after a bit of trouble at her house, she's upset he didn't tell her that he was in security.  Um... when was he supposed to tell her?...  when he had his tongue down her throat or during sex?In the first half of the book there was nothing likable about the characters.  Max comes off as a stalker, who you question how he ever gained the skill or discipline to be the owner of a successful PI/security firm.  Jordan comes off as unreasonable and paranoid. Overall, that gives me no reason to read further, neither character were likable or relate-able.  I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a far fetched story, but the characters, and their actions, should make sense within the context of that story.Now, don't think I have high expectations for Shakespearean-like story telling for every author I read.

At every opportunity to believe in her, her ""husband"" failed but in Kat's mind that was all right because, apparently when you've got piercing blue eyes and a six-pack, you can squeeze your wife's face so hard she cries and it's taken as a sign of what a passionate, conflicted, deep man you are. Am I the only one who wondered what happened to the plotline of Kat being erased from existence if her ancestor was killed?

7717,"This isn't the only book of this nature by a long shot, I just don't get it.Basically, the idea is that David bailed on Ethan years ago because he had a thing for him.  So, Ethan puts together an elaborate ruse to get David on an island alone.  Then, he tells David that he doesn't get any food or shelter unless he submits to his whims, and that he can't leave.The author kind of tries to paint David as conflicted rather than completely against the idea, but really - it shouldn't matter should it?  Even if some part of someone wants someone else, they should still get to choose.  And no, having food held hostage while the other person gets you worked up and then pretends your final acquiescence is consent is not a real choice.I can't figure how anyone thinks this stuff is romantic at all.  BDSM is all about the submissive partner having the power to put a stop to the behavior or the relationship at any time.  Once you take that away, it isn't games between consenting adults, it is just bullying and abuse of power.  Bullying and abuse aren't romantic, even when the victim claims to be OK with it.  I spent the parts of this book that I managed to finish feeling awful for David, who was being bullied into doing something he did not wish to do.I do wonder why we've managed to reduce the prevalence of rape fantasies in m/f romance, but people still accept it in m/m romance.",negative,book

By contrast, read free online articles from experienced authorities.I began to suspect this author was a fraud when I saw not one footnote, not one end note, nor any references. He quotes people without referring to the source of the quote. Did he use online quote sources? I doubt he ever read anything about trials or jury selection, other than quickie articles available on the 'net.

2662,"This novella is so bad, I don't know where to start. The set up is a common thread in shifter stories, but I can accept that and move on. This is definitely an Erotica book because it is mostly sex with really no story. Don't get me wrong, I like Erotica and a really good love scene but this one left me high and dry. In the midst of the sex/love scenes in this story I actually had to look to see how much longer it was (and not 'Oh my why couldn't it be longer' but a 'Holy Cow I still have that much left to read of this crap.') Then there is the story that starts to unfold at the beginning but is never fleshed out once the sex starts. Whatever is so important that he is nearly killed guarding is never explained. The ending comes out of nowhere like the author was done writing her 30 pages of sex and needed to end the book. Then there is some of the language. I can't decide if the author was trying to use bigger words to sound educated, draw an educated reader, or just having fun with the synonyms button in Word. However, it doesn't work. Lets face it, anyone who picks up this story isn't looking for a language lesson and some of the terminology used takes the sincerity out of the book. Yes, I KNOW what ""turgid"" means but you won't hear me using that in my daily conversations and it is used multiple times in this very short story. Then there is redundancy issues like it wasn't edited before being published. Come on ""trembling tremors"" just sounds dumb and calling it her sex 10 times in a row to then switch to pussy for the next 10 times.

Second, if you are going to write a book with a military service member as a lead character, than at least have have basic details correct, i.e.  do not refer to an officer as having enlisted unless it's clear he began as an enlisted service member, otherwise credibility goes down the drain. Also the feelings of love didn't come through, just that they enjoyed the sex between them. The rest of my lack of enjoyment in this book is likely due to the fact I generally stay away from these books and had purchased it first for a friend to read.

Unless you like to read YA's with child-like characters, I do NOT recommend this book.

7136,"***SPOILERS*** Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Book 1 in a mind-numbingly uninspired paranormal romance about Polar bear shifters. Surprisingly bland and lackluster, despite the beautiful setting. Writing clear and accessible, but dialogue falls flat. I would have imagined that it would be nearly impossible to take a gorgeous Alaskan wilderness cabin fever story and ruin it, but that's what happened here. Only redeeming quality: it took barely two hours to read it, so I didn't waste much time.MAIN ISSUE: Complete lack of tension, conflict or plot. From the first moment Carson slips naked into the bed of a sleeping Ruby- before even introducing himself- to the very end, there was no conflict at all. The closest this story ever comes to conflict is the remarkably nave Ruby hesitating over living out in the middle of nowhere. In the end there is a pathetic attempt at compromise over this issue where Carson agrees to go to Chicago, but then the book ends thereby eliminating any idea that this would have caused conflict and you are left to assume that he does, they have a good time, but ultimately decide to go back to Alaska where they belong and live happily ever after.There were a few places this story could have found a real plot:1. Ruby could have resisted. Instead she has NO TROUBLE AT ALL believing in shape shifters and very little trouble believing in mates. She doesn't even get upset about essentially being felt up by a stranger, being unnaturally attracted to a stranger, or being lied to by both her sister and her strange new lover. Would you be upset if your sister essentially lured you out into the wilderness to meet your destined mate without any warning?? I would have knee capped her.2. Perhaps Ruby herself was unique. There was a reference to the fact that it wasn't normal for the woman to dream of the man, though Ruby did. Instead of pursuing this potentially interesting twist, Carson literally said ""Does it really matter?"" To which Ruby responds ""I guess not."" Okay, so much for curiosity.3. The sister could have actually been missing. Carson and Ruby could have had to work together to save her and his brother...Nope. None of those things happened. There was no plot. No problems or conflicts to be resolved beyond a lack of pop tarts and Lucky Charms. Carson didn't have to court her or woo her or win her over even a little. Nobody had to be rescued. Nobody had to adapt or change. Ruby and Carson never even fought. There was no passion, no spark. They were just automatically attracted to each other enough that any objections were rendered moot. I ask you, what about that strikes you as romantic.Even the magic was muted and pathetic- nothing beyond shifting and only one character does it, even then he only does it once and there are a few minor body changes. They don't even change into real bears for goodness sakes!! Ruby never gets to see this change AND NEVER EVEN ASKS!!! Can you imagine??? Meeting mythical creatures that can change shape, falling in love with one and not even being curious about what the hell they look like, never mind Ruby's defining characteristic was supposed to be her curiosity.BOTTOM LINE: This was the most boring para-romance I've ever read. Ever.RECOMMENDATIONS: ANY of these would be better, but there are TONS to choose from the I don't even have the space to list...1. Vivian Arend'sWolf Signs: Granite Lake Wolves, Book 1fun, light were-romance series2. Vivian Arend'sTidal Wave: Forces of Nature, Book 1- with frolicking dolphins3. Kresley Cole's slightly more adventurous  and intricate magical romance series (never mind the ridiculous title):A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)4. Loribelle Hunt's sexually daring werewolf romanceOnce Bitten [Spellbound Moon 1]5. Sherrilyn Kenyon'sFantasy Lover- Dark Hunter series with shifters, vamps and Greek gods. The first book is not as good as the rest- it just gets better and better.6. Renee Michaels' more sexually adventurous werewolf romanceHer Chosen Wolf: The Were Chronicles, Book 17. Moira Rogers' basic werewolf romance series:Cry Sanctuary: Book 1 of Red Rock Pass series8. Moira Rogers' magically diverse romance seriesCrux: Southern Arcana, Book 19. Nalini Singh'sSlave to Sensation (Psy-Changelings, Book 1)- romance series which features weres and psychics, but also carries plotlines with some substance10. Sydney Somers' gargoyle spin on romance:Primal Hunger: Pendragon Gargoyles, Book 111. Christine Warren's somewhat inconsistent, but often awesome series Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 1) - skip the one about werecats, it had a weak female lead",negative,book
2139,"I HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK.  I did anticipate it with excitement, though.  I read the first two in this series and thoroughly enjoyed them.  I really like sequels and the peeks into the lives of the former characters.  It makes the proceeding books seem like continued chapters of the first story.  The first book begged for sequels for each of the Grayhawk brothers and I was excited that Ms. Lee would write more about them.  I usually read the description of a book and then drop down to read the reviews.  I take them with a grain of salt, depending on the viewpoint of the writer, my interest in the description and my affection for the author.  Unfortunately, the reviews I read were very disappointing; so much so that I do not want to purchase this book.  There were a couple of suggestions for Ms. Lee, including making the next books more true to the characters and the theme of the previous books.  My suggestion -- which may seem a bit farfetched -- is for Ms. Lee to rewrite the third book.  The readers and lovers of the first two books, I am sure, would be forgiving if Ms. Lee were to rewrite the third book and keep Peyton true and believable.  I, for one, would be glad to purchase it and would heartfully await the stories of the other brothers with baited breath.  Ms. Lee, please consider it.  I would love to move forward in this series.  Thank you.",negative,book

972,"Tessa blows into Darinthian Ambassador Kortal's office looking for her missing sister on his home planet where people are ""linked"" by magic - as Tessa and Kortal are now, according to some gut feeling of his.  Apparently, this means now that she's entered his domain, she's surrendered to whatever he wants, which he tells her is her ""body, mind and spirit.""Moments after he tells her this, she's inexplicably, violently crazed with lust until he satisfies her (quite easily), then as she tries to fight him, he subdues her with sex again, then he builds her up and demands she wears his collar, which she agrees to in a haze of lust.  He ties her up because he knows when the magic wears off, she'll be ticked off and try to leave him before he can do the sex mojo thing on her again.It's all explicit and if you like that kind of thing without it being necessarily erotic or having any emotional element, than you'll enjoy this.  Tessa and Kortal have absolutely no emotional connection; she's his possession from the moment she walks into his office and she's struck deaf and dumb with lust immediately because of some super mind-bending ability of his; when he's not around, she comes to her senses, then loses them again when he returns.This is from Ellora's Cave, and if you're familiar with them, this particular story would fit with their Exotica collection in my opinion (it contains stories that are more unusual, push boundaries and don't necessarily include affection or happily ever afters), although I don't think this writing is up to par with the authors that are generally included in that series.",negative,book

11422,"I understand it's religious fiction but it was condescendingly preachy. If any religious zealots know of a girl pregnant or with a child out of wedlock this is the handbook they would give to them to make her feel as low and bad as possible about her big bad 'sin'. She feels the need to publicly confess her sin. Just give them the avenue they need to stone you Vivian. That is ridiculous!Billy is a nice man but he's too preachy. Lessons about God can be given without copy/pasting scripture. As a Christian, this book made me sick and ashamed like I am when I see people who claim to be Christian and do nothing but judge and judge other people. This is the nauseating type of Christian.Vivian has a baby out of wedlock and is always thinking she's about to be smite down for her grave sin. The relationship between her and her baby is weird. Sure she was raised in an orphanage from 14 to 20 but still. EVERY woman knows you breastfeed a baby. How she never clued in that the baby needs to be breastfed is ridiculous. Billy notices but never mentions it.She didn't act like the baby's mother and she even mentions having a friend at the orphanage who was good with the babies. Well, Marie sure didn't tell her anything about babies because even monkeys have better natural parenting skills. They say if baby is lost in the jungle a monkey would be the best protection for them. But Vivian doesn't even have monkey sense as a mother.That and WAY TOO PREACHY.

Much of the time I'll skip reviewing just because I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. Not this time.This book lacks character development and the protagonist (who has zero development- in fact I'd say she has negative character development as far as I am concerned- if that is even possible!) is nothing. This seems like a book written by a teenager... a young teenager, but it turns out not to be the case.There are stereotypes galore- i.e. her token black roommate named ""Tyreen"" that says ""mo fo"" a lot. I found that eye-rollingly offensive.Our leading lady- in the midst of a disaster at her college, asks if they will be renting a chalet in Gatlinburg. Her family is supposed to be from Richmond, VA and she is going to school in Tennessee. It's not a chalet down here. It's a cabin. And if serial killers/monsters are taking over your college and killing a bunch of co-eds that look like you, do you really want to go to a cabin in the woods?! Then again, our character is in the lead for the Darwin award.The protagonist, Txema (obligatory exotic name probably looked up on baby name website), is really stupid. There were how many murders in 24-48 hours and she 1) decides to meet her boyfriend after dark at the library across campus instead of him picking her up at her dorm for no apparent reason than she wants to die and 2) she decides that not only her personal safety and that of her beloved roommate is worth less than an iPad and a book. She sneaks past guards put up for the safety of those on campus. When her boyfriend's house is torn to shreds it literally doesn't cross her mind until Tyreen verbally tears her up for not calling the police.She doesn't even care to really find out what her boyfriend's fate was until he is thrust back into her life to knock her up with an audience. She's trying to figure out who she wants to sleep with with literally no regard beyond a ""I wonder if my boyfriend, best friend and her boyfriend were eaten"" (not a quote, more of a paraphrase).This story has (as mentioned before), no character development. The plot was completely disorganized and stupid.If you are looking for a Pulitzer prize winner- Don't bother.If you are looking for a great adventure/fantasy book- Don't bother.If you are looking for a decent romance book- Don't bother.If you are looking for some mindless drivel to keep you preoccupied- Don't bother.SERIOUSLY- pass on this one.",negative,book

He let's his brother get into his head that Ray is looking for another man and not really focused on going back to school.

2552,I thought with all the positive reviews I would love this book.  Not! This book is horrible it starts fast (literally she is in love with one man in the morning and in love with another by the evening) and the premise of indecent proposal wasn't even done well.  The heroine I'm sorry I found her stupid and greedy.  She was the worst that you would think of someone from the country just ignorant she made us look bad.  So glad I haven't  spent the $5.99 a piece for the other two books in the series maybe if the price goes down.  I just don't see a billionaire being so enamored by a Black Country chick with no education and obviously no common sense that he will do anything to get her even offer her and her fianc&eacute; a million bucks.  Sorry for the spoilers but I found myself disgusted with Daisy and her treatment of Pete.  For those that love Aiden and Daisy together so much especially based on this book they deserve each other two crazy people together.  She was so in love with Pete and ready to marry him the next day until someone dangles a million dollars in your face and all you can think about is not your future happiness with the man you love but what you can do with the money.  Maybe she buys some self respect and common sense in the other books.  I am just so disappointed I really wanted to like this.  There is not explanation or build up to why Aiden like/loves Daisy so much.  I also just couldn't get past Daisy the only character I did like was Pete he was genuine and as a character I felt he was the most developed.  Daisy was who she was but in relation to Aiden I just didn't get that his character was developed enough to justify his like/lust/love for her.,negative,book

9752,"First off the it took me months to finish this book.  I am OCD so I had to finish it unwillingly!  Right off the bat, how can anyone fall in love with a guy who from day one treats you like your are the scourge of the earth!? First he kidnaps you, then the day following your kidnapping, since his housekeeper/cook is not there in the morning, you make him breakfast because gee you're so nice and sweet.  Oh, there's more, afterwards you make out with him after her forces a kiss on you because you find his witty insults so irresistible!! To make this love story even better he offers you to be his mistress but feeling insulted you deny him.  Oh wait, then you give your virginity like after 4 days of knowing him, because he took you horse back riding, and snorkeling while the whole time he insulted you saying that you're a conniving gold digger!!  Oh, that's right Stockholm syndrome!!  After he takes your virginity he believes you and lets you call your twin which is the one to marry his brother. But loll and behold, he still doesn't believe you're better than a conniving gold digger and you're only good to be his mistress, yet you gave him your virginity because he's sooooo irresistible!!That's why it took me months to finish this book.  I wanted to kill both of the main characters, I saw no redeeming qualities for Nikias and Diona was just wrong in the head.  The story doesn't end there, but I will not continue writing about it because it just ticks me off.  Anyways, back to my review; the author needs help editing, usage of words, periods and comas.  I have noticed also that a lot of writers don't seem to know that woman is the singular and women is the plural of the word (I had to say it, it's just one of those things that really bug me about the grammar) NO I would not recommend this book not even to my worst enemy, and NO I won't be reading anything else from this writer.",negative,book

However, I could not finish the book, it was just too creepy - instead of looking forward to the next plot development I just felt dread at what awful thing was going to happen, probably to some woman, next.

9270,"I bought this based on all the wonderful reviews.  So I feel obligated to post my opinion since I had a very different reading experience.I was looking for a nice little sci-fi erotica novella and instead got written porn.  It was pages and pages of sex with no emotion build up. No emotional investment or interest for me as a reader in the characters. (Literally she opens the door the H says hello, doesn't even introduce himself and within half a page the first sex scene starts.) On top of that I found that there was no real character development - the H starts out wanting to make the H love him and with a tendency to be sexually /emotionally dominant. The h is not all that likeable, closed off and bratty  - but she amazingly goes from this to letting him get ""into"" all her emotional shields in a day and a half with what can only be the sex..... As for the plot I was hard pressed to find one, his trying to get her love??????The sad thing was, there was so much potential in this little novella: an emotionally scarred heroine who in a last ditch effort orders a custom husband who comes out with some ""extras"" from her Christmas shopping list, a hero hoping for love, a loving family, and interfering friends intent on making her happy that could have played lots of hijinks on the road to happily ever after - instead of just being mentioned.If you need story, plot, or characters with any depth I would suggest skipping this one.

I love to read all types of stories, however this one confuses me from the start. The first person viewpoint is even more confusing. Hard for me to keep track on which is speaking and where it ends. I wouldn't mind a little bit more detail and especially the thrills except- there is only a crumble to none at all. I would have loved the author to make some changes, add some more descriptive and help us &#8211; the readers- identify who is actually talking and when. Also to show if it is a thought and not continued conversation &#8211; which if I had the actual book in hand- want to throw it to the wall.Linda caught cheating &#8211; then dies but is not &#8211; but the conversation &#8211; ugghhh so irritating to read from the get go. Once I am irritated- that is it.Overall, if you are the type of person who is rushed and loves to confuse everyone &#8211; then this one is for you.

It's hard to read when you can't stop rolling your eyes.  Based on the plot-line, I expected more.  As another reviewer said, what professional would sleep with a wild cat in her home, and sleeping next to her like an overgrown tabby?  This author really needs to watch a few episodes of Animal Planet's ""Fatal Attractions"" series.The ""heroine"" was an idiot.  She could remember the names of NONE of the volunteers on the preserve, and acted like they were all stupid, (in one scene, she overslept and was four hours late, then was pissed when the volunteers went searching for a tiger without her).  The ""hero"" had nothing to recommend him either except that he was well endowed.  The sex scenes weren't even hot.  They were way too drawn out and basically the same text repeated in every scene, just a different position.  I've watched pornos with better plot development than this book had.It's this type of book that makes me wish Amazon had a program to refund all or some of your money when you purchase horrible books.

Guess this is just a teaser leading up to their honeymoon and how annoying Keely will be in any subsequent books.This was not what I expect when reading a romance book and it didn't make me want to read any of the other books in this series.

8425,"Rio is an FBI agent, a member of the Financial and Violent Crimes division (FVC). She and her parter, Eddie, are attracted to each other. And someone is threatening her life.This is the sequel to ""Broken Wings"" and, if I didn't know any better, I'd wonder if the main character was a different person. Yes, there's this blurb in the beginning saying she's been forced to forget her soul connection by the powers that be, but now she's clueless and helpless. Unfortunately, all of her coworkers at the FBI seem to be inept as well. I mean, Rio can go deep undercover to trap a mobster on a case that took years to develop, yet she and her colleagues can't handle one little stalker? And they break procedure numerous times regarding the threatening letters. Any civilian friend or relative who interrupted or threatened an undercover operation would be in big trouble, possibly arrested for interfering with police procedure, and the agent involved would be censured and maybe even fired. In her previous work you can tell the author did some background work. This thing is full of more holes than Swiss cheese.Dialogue and romantic development has also taken a serious nosedive. Propositioning the love interest by saying, ""Oh baby....Let me help you. Let me ease your pain""? Oh, please let me not read another nauseating cliche! There are several places where scene transition is rough or illogical, grammar errors are more egregious, and, to top it off, the author rewrote the main character's history. I really hope this was ghost written because otherwise it means that this was produced as a quick money-making followup to the first book and I fell for it.",negative,book

3366,"This is not a book to be set aside lightly. This is a book to be put down and avoided entirely.What I've found aggravating about self published books lately is how, inevitably, they are edited by the author's friends or family members. While I'm sure they're all very nice people, they are not experienced in helping a story achieve cohesion. They also don't want to hurt your feelings.This book suffers from a lack of good, critical feedback. We are hardly introduced to the heroine before she's immediately whisked off into a highly unlikely series of events that she doesn't understand, so how could the reader?Without knowing more about the heroine, why would I care what happens to her?All the supernaturals are the same as they ever were - cold vampires, hot werewolves, ineffectual witches. The author describes four unrelated characters as having flame red hair and emerald eyes. That's a lot of freaking redheads with. Cliched green eyes, which are just not that common.There's an issue with the heroine initially being attracted to virtually every man she meets, so her insta-love with yet another man had little impact.Style wise, the plethora of choppy short sentences beginning with &#34;I&#34; just grated. I did this, I did that. &#34;I walked to the door. He stood at the door. I went through the door. He followed me.&#34; Then a giant info-dump. Rinse and repeat. Just jerky and inept - I found myself editing silently for flow and consistency.Some embarrassing mistakes - &#34;ying to her yang&#34; - and equally embarrassing attempts at sarcastic humor, none of which were successful. Instead, heroine did a whole lot of adolescent and pointless whining about herself even when a huge apocalyptic Bad Thing was taking place.This book strikes me as one that would probably get an A as a high school project and impress friends and loved ones, but just isn't at a professional level yet.

9836,"In paranormal I need to be able to view the hero as somewhat human.  I had a hard time managing that with this story.  In the beginning a Zorn Warrior,  Argernon, saves Casey from men who are chasing her.  Argernon & Casey can't communicate so he just throws her over his shoulder & carries her to a cave he's been using while scouting out her planet.  She thinks he's a bigfoot and wants to take him home and keep him because he's ""hot"".  Apparently, he thinks she's hot too, because he grunts/growls at her while gesturing for her to take off her clothes while he strips & continuously points between her & his bed.  Of course, she doesn't usually do this type of thing, but he's hot so even though they've just met, all reservations are set aside.  She strips and gets in bed, still thinking he's a bigfoot.  In the midst of deciding to have sex with him, she even decides she doesn't need to worry about getting pregnant because different species, like cats & dogs, can't procreate.  Just Ewww!When Casey finds herself on Argernon's ship, communication occurs, & she finds out he isn't a bigfoot but an alien and plans to take her to his planet.  She becomes uncooperative.  In several scenes he ties her up and forces himself inside her (while she's pleading with him to leave her alone) because he can smell her excitement.  He even smilingly asks, in his all-knowing male way, if men on her planet are so weak that they listen when women say no.  ?!?!On top of all this, I thought Casey acted completely immature, getting mad at Argernon and throwing fits for stuff that was completely out of his control (but forgiving him for rape), the story was dumb, and the writing was juvenile.  And I liked the first book enough to pay for this second in the series!  I won't be reading this author again.And this is so petty, I hate to mention it, but did anyone else think the cover was unappealing?

Just as an example, the death of two people who are discovered in a crash train car are proclaimed as ""not accidental"" by the police - what gave it away, the multiple stab wounds or the fact that the bodies were already in rigor and the train car just crashed.  A monopoly on world food supplies by controlling the seeds - anyone ever hear of Burpees.The whole opening scene consists of our ""hero"" chasing after a runaway train car (to do what we have no idea since it's a 70 ton runaway) and causes several traffic accidents that kill innocent people and we're somehow supposed to overlook that because he had a higher purpose in somehow warning the town of the runaway car.  It made absolutely no sense to me and even the crash scene is so exaggerated as to be unbelievable (do you really think a fully loaded boxcar is going to slide that far on it's ride after coming off the rails - come on).The story line was weak, the characters shallow and not particularly likeable and the protagonist can seemingly kill at will without getting caught.  This is the one of the few times I bought a Kindle version of a book without downloading a sample first because of all the positive reviews.  Wish I'd saved the $3.00 as the sample would have taken me far enough into the book to realize this just isn't a good book.My apologies to all those that read and absolutely raved about this book.  There are so many well written, exciting and suspenseful books in the Kindle library that something as trite as this just doesn't deserve to be read.  I'm obviously in the minority here but do follow my suggestion and sample the book before buying.",negative,book
1,"When I read the description for this book, I couldn't wait to read it. Once I downloaded it to my Kindle, I found it extremely hard to keep reading it.  To be honest, I stopped reading halfway through the book. It began slow and remained a slow, uninteresting read.  It lacked passion; not making love passion, but passion for life. Neither Jada or Aaron were interesting characters and the story was too, too `everything is perfect'.  Everybody is just so understanding and accommodating--the bit of drama with his father and her grandmother was blah.  To give an example of what I mean (and there are MANY), Aaron finally finds out almost  half way into the book that he fathered a child 5 years ago--keep in mind that Aaron and Jada kept in contact for a few months after he left and she never mentioned to him that she was pregnant. When she finally tells him he has a son, Aaron becomes overwhelmed with emotions (misty eyed) knowing that he's a father. WTH!  I think most men would be upset/angry to know that they had a child and the woman they love never told them! Not in this book; it's all good--all is well; NO PASSION.  OMG, don't let me get started on the scene when father and son finally meet. It was so over the top, it made me want to barf. Maybe if this scene had been towards the beginning of the book, it would have been touching. In the middle of the book after just too much blah it made me thrown down my kindle.  It was like eating a sweet dessert that was so sweet it made your teeth hurt. This book had a good theme, but no follow-through. Also, if we're to believe that Jada graduated from Harvard, then let it be reflected in her speech and her job. We're told that she has this wonderful personality which caused Aaron to fall in love with her--never saw it. If the author had described her as depressed and foolish--Yes! I would believe it in a heartbeat. She was boring. This book was so frustrating to read.  I truly struggled to read it as far as I did.  I finally stopped torturing myself because I realized it wasn't going to get any better.",negative,book

Event the prologue begins with the actual story, not in the past when Kasie overheard the conversation between Amory and her father. That would have set the story up. I mean, come on, who says being a tomboy means you can't be a real woman, which is what is intimated in this novel. Or that women have certain work they should be doing and men have other work and neither the twain shall meet? She actually used the term woman's work! What is with the whole virtue thing also? I men, if my father asked me if I had been violated at age 24, I would have told him to mind his own business. She's been engaged twice but is still has not been violated? Who says that? At least make it a life style choice. By the way, I'm not a 20 something, I'm a grandmother. Also, smoking indoors? Really? And only the mean light up? What century are we in? That is part of the problem with this novel. Most of the time as I read this, I felt like I was reading one that took place 100 years ago, not today. However, the female lead character is a computer programmer. There are secondary characters that are stuck in just to explain the plot but the connections are never made between them and the main characters. And then we have the idea that the main character is a bigot and that's why she didn't marry the guy in the first place. I mean, wasn't she terribly hurt by him and that's why she left? And her father is married to a Native American. On that note, who uses the term Indian any more? I managed to finish this book, but only because I hoped it would improve. It didn't.

11948,"I couldn't finish. There are strong points - the core story is familiar (average Joe's life is destroyed, works to obtain revenge), and the details of that story are handled reasonably well.  Valdieron and his life are introduced deliberately to permit us to feel some sympathy before the forces of evil wreak havoc in his life.  Mr. Day conveys a familiar cozy set of place and then burns it to the ground so that we feel Valdieron's anger.  Unfortunately after that the plot advances through external exposition.  Some sort of ghost or ancient spirit has been waiting for centuries to pass along plot exposition which isn't very interesting or well written.  But the second or third appearance the ghost is assigning quests.  At which point the story falls apart.  I lose interest in books where the characters' actions are driven by external forces.  Conflict and drama arise through character motivation and action.I'm also somewhat allergic to the super-human scale of ""save the world"" - Day's conceit that demons are invading from another dimension was introduced well enough to permit me to ignore the scale of the plot at first.  As long as the characters were learning about the external threat through actions that were intrinsic to the story, I was willing to coast along and ignore the end of the world. But if the story is so weak that it needs the services of a century old ghost to move things along, then I've lost interest.  Those ghosts are, both metaphorically and literally, less than two dimensional characters.  Every moment that the protagonist spends interacting with them is stolen from potential character development that would result from the protagonist's interaction with a real, motivated, three dimensional character.I'm surprised because Mr. Day shows a commendable restraint on other matters. There are relatively few superlatives - the main character is scaled like a normal human, not like the astonishingly gifted heroes that inhabit much fantasy fiction. Unlike many other low budget fantasy novels I've read recently, women are depicted well and fairly.  In scenes where gender doesn't matter, gender is given no more attention than hair color or dress; just another attribute to enable the reader to remember who is who. In the very few scenes where gender does matter, it is not possible to predict the character's action based on their gender.  In point of fact the female romantic lead had the promise to be one of the more interesting characters in the book with real, conflicted motivation.I'd suggest that Mr. Day have a chat with a horse person before writing about stallions again; I'm given to understand that leaving a stallion in the middle of a herd of unfamiliar horses isn't the wisest idea.Ultimately I've got a limited amount of time in my life to read, and I'd rather spend it on something with fewer, less obtrusive plot devices.",negative,book

She is portrayed as a complete slut, unable to make it through the day without sex.  She is seriously without any redeeming attributes...doesn't want to be helpful....willing to do all three brothers on the same day - not because she is interested in a menage - simply because she is apparently constantly horny.  The leap to ""love"" for the brothers and her is non-existant.  They remember a 12 year old child, and BAM - the day she returns they are in love with her.  Talk about a leap of the imagination.  The way the sex was portrayed in this book actually gave me the heebies - and I stated before - I like the concept of menage relationships.  This book was just too unbelievable to swallow.

The rapper was extremely difficult to understand speech wise, probably because I didn't have an ebonics dictionary right next to me.  The woman seemed to waffle back and forth about seeing this guy, and there seemed to be little or no history built into these characters in that short time frame of the book. Perhaps further along in the book, there is some insight as to why these two people act the way they do, but not being able to understand the speech patterns or methodology of these people made it too difficult for me to be able to care enough to get to that point.

Knowing the power of their sexual heat, Wynn brings home a book on sex magick that will allow the two of them to harness their sexual energy and use it to cast spells.Sounds great doesn't it?Sadly, the story isn't much longer than what I just wrote. It was a ten minute read. Definately a short story. Don't expect a novella. There just isn't enough there to justify my time or the two bucks. Heck, for five bucks I can have a three hundred page novel.So, maybe you are just in the mood for a good, sexy read. Not so much. Yep. They have sex. Most of the pages are rife with sex, but it is vanilla and frankly saying that it is 'hot sex' doesn't make it hot sex. Deets help. Maybe a little stamina? Maybe a little experimentation out of the box?? Heck we are talking pagans here right?

They are few and far between and hard to find.Since there weren't any reviews I downloaded a sample, it  was lovely, so I bought the book.  It was $5.11 for my Kindle, around average for a FULL LENGTH ebook.  Imagine my suprise when I realized after 20 mins. of reading, I was 60% thru the book!  Nowhere in the book description does it say Novella or Short Story, PLUS the book ends way before 100%(93% approx)they don't give page numbers, sorry non-Kindlers.  That's the only way I can give the book length! So, I paid full book price and got the equivalent of 4-6 chapters.BUT, I think the actual story itself was decent. If it could be expanded upon and made into a full length book, it would be worthy of it's price and I would have given it 4 stars(If it had been a good rewrite of course!)I do think that Amazon should perhaps make it mandatory for authors of books/novellas/short stories under a certain word count to inform their readers of the length of the book.  It's not right to pay for and expect a full length book yet get something entirely different.  EVEN IF the story is cute.  Most of the other stories around this length run from $.99-$1.99.

11972,"after reading the first part of this story, i decided to read this second part thinking it had to get better.  i was wrong.  jaycee has had a horrible life.  she was gang raped by her step-father and his werewolf pack on her 16th birthday. she escaped and was on the run ever since until her alpha mate decided to claim her after waiting two years to do so.  it turns out that dane's brother mark is also her mate.  then pierre was her mate briefly until he was killed and then dane, mark and remi (another alpha) tricked her into mating with remi with what was essentially rape.  and this was before pierre was even buried.  then for the rest of the 1st story they lied to her, didn't trust her judgement and disrespected her in front of the pack.  all the while telling her they loved her and wanted what is best for her. throughout both parts of the story her step-father is trying to get her back and keeps attacking the pack.  the end of the 1st story is : to be continued. (spoiler alert)  so in the 2nd story when she finally thinks they really care for her they trick her into getting pregnant and she leaves. they follow her and because the bad guys also follow and she fights them after she protects herself and her baby, remi and dane are furious with her and end up spending the nite with 2 women from the feline pack that lives there.  when she comes down from the loft they are rubbing themselves all over remi and dane, who just look at her.  they drag her back to their pack and even when they find out remi's baby was never in danger they are still mad at her and give her the cold shoulder. now this is where i really hated this book, after hurting jaycee time and time and time again, in front of the pack home 2 of the pack females come up to dane and remi and rub themselves all over them with jaycee standing right there.  then they say that they heard dane and remi had spent the nite with 2 other women when they were gone. (i couldn't help but wonder how they had heard that unless dane or remi told the pack) and offered their services for that nite. dane and remi turn and look at jaycee who says she would like them to spend the nite with her, but it is their choice.  then she goes to their room and prepares herself for them and puts candles all over the room.  she falls asleep and wakes up hours later with the candles all burned out and no mates. she puts on a robe cuz she has on a very revealing teddy with strategic cut outs that remi had gotten her before all this had happened, and goes down the stairs to the kitchen.  on the kitchen table are two naked women, with dane and remi's face buried in their nether regions.  they look up and see jaycee devasted and realize she had expected them to spend the nite with her and that THEY HAVE GONE TOO FAR.  PLEASE, HOW CAN THEY EVEN DO THAT TO THEIR MATE? then the story goes on about how they feel so bad that they hurt her so much.  but of course after groveling for two seconds she takes them back again.  i have never read a shape-shifter story, wolf or otherwise, that treated a mate in this manner. i love menage shifter stories, but i hated this one. the 2 stories were filled with pain and cruelity. some of the reviews for the 1st part of the story said how hot the sex was-how can it be hot when they treat their mate like she is just a convient body to get their rocks off on when they are not mad at her?  amazon should pull this story and the 1st part also. don't waste your money on it. i certainly won't be buying anymore of her books.",negative,book

What are they thinking?When Mira participates in an event we note that she has an idea or does something, but not how she feels. We're told she's afraid of someone but not why or how it affects her behavior. Traumatic things happen but they are never thought of again. Mira's parents move around and talk like a Stepford family.

9380,"This book started out interesting and went downhill from there.  Perhaps in the last third of the story I would have found something redeeming in it, but I'll never know...I gave up on it shortly after Mark makes it home from his protracted detention with the CIA.First, I give credit where credit is due.  The author is good with pen and paper.  His prose flowed and he's well practiced at clicking two words together to make a thought.  For that, I give him kudos.The story, however, is one mad depression from start to finish (or at least to as far as I got).  The cynical tone in the title says it all.  And the story elaborates.  We find that intelligent, and well-meant officials of the CIA can take the word of a man who is hell-bent on confusing that fine Intelligence Organization with a red herring, and turn the life of an innocent, nay not just innocent, but fine and upstanding member of the American Continuum into utter chaos, even though all they have is that one confession made under torture.  Perhaps there have been real honest mistakes made like poor Mark Taylor, but I found myself saying, ""no, this makes no sense.""  I could see them taking in an innocent Middle eastern American and treating him this way (because they are at heart racist bigots), but not someone who looks like an altar boy from Northern Scotland, ready to take vows.  As far as I was concerned, the premise was flawed from the beginning.  I kept expecting the ""thriller"" portion to cut in when Mark Taylor breaks out, finds the culprit who framed him and then sets the world right, but that never happens.  Even after he is released, life goes downhill rapidly for him.  I suppose there is some redeeming moment in the book when he shakes of the shackles of oppression and decides that he is going to fight for justice and the rights of his fellow humanity, but I never saw it coming and I never will. I gave up reading it.You've heard of jingoistic diatribes?  Well this is the same kind of claptrap, only coming at the reader from the opposite end of the spectrum.  If you simply enjoy a good book for the escape it provides, then don't pick this one up because, admittedly, this is a well-drawn picture of hell on earth.  If you enjoy torture, a never-ending spiral downward where everyone turns against you (after all if the CIA thinks you're evil, you must be) and a depressing tale that includes a heaping helping of abuse upon the best efforts of our government to fight terrorism, then go ahead and pick it up.  If that's the kind if read you enjoy then you probably watch Apocalypse Now once a week as vindication of the filthiness of the human condition, especially as it is manifest in the American soul.

10996,"The story of who murdered liquor store owner, Manny, and now threatens the life of high school teacher, Jessie Jones, could have been an interesting tale in the hands of a capable author.  Unfortunately, what we have here is an inane full length book that should have been a short story at best.  It is 5% story and 95% filler fluff.I keep asking myself WHEN novice story writers will cop to the fact that page after page of painful inner dialogue by the main (or any) character is a sure fire way to make any book a big fat zero.This 'book' is all over the place.  The author would have done well to sit down prior to writing and compose an outline as to what the main theme of the book would be and then FOLLOW that outline.  There is so much ridiculous, extraneous activity going on that it is close to impossible to follow what I took to be the main point of the book: the murder of Manny and the protagonist's unwilling involvement in the crime.In one scene you have some silly mishmash about an upcoming wedding, in several others you have Jessie doing battle with the big 'meanies' in her life...characters, by the way, who are so one dimensional as to be laughable.  In other scenes she is agonizing over a long dead romance (ten years) when her erstwhile lover turns out to be lead investigator on the murder at hand.These characters insult the reader's intelligence mercilessly.  Are we really supposed to believe that Jessie, after narrowly escaping death and then having her house torched, lists wearing a hideous maid of honor dress in her sister's wedding as one of her top three current concerns?  Give me a break.Another idiotic character is that of Jessie's mother.  This is a woman who supposedly made her way through medical school and became a respected surgeon while at the same time raising two children and yet whose main focus is getting her daughters married off.  The mindset just doesn't jibe.I find myself skipping page after page after page of imbecilic tripe just to get to the next coherent passage that might just relate to the mystery at hand.I'm afraid that whomever murdered Manny will have to remain a mystery to me because I've lost all patience with this miserable excuse for a book.",negative,book

11669,"It is very frustrating to see authors/publishers loading part of a story for free and then selling you the follow-up pieces.  Free books should be free.  If you want to give me a free sample of a book, then be honest about it in the description.  This ""book"" ends right in the middle of a conversation.It isn't even very good.  Jane Porter takes a vow of celibacy after finding out that her ""master"" is married (I put that in quotation marks because that is what she calls him, but she seems to be very unfamiliar with the lifestyle later in the story - it was difficult to figure out exactly what her experience level was).  After a year, she attends a BDSM-themed party she set up as a party planner.  This whole turn of events was so incredibly unrealistic.  First of all, a guy was throwing it for his half-brother.  Who throws a party like that for a  sibling?  Nobody in the book was engaging in any sort of negotiation or conversation about what they wanted to do.  It was just guys throwing their weight around while mouthing bland inane nothings like ""You know that a submissive is really in charge of the scene?""  Well, if that's the case, then maybe try talking about what she wants, what she is looking for in the scene, what isn't on the table for the session?  The whole reason Jane got into a bad situation in the first place was because she didn't talk to her ""master,"" but she's going to get right back into that same mistake again?

11291,"****SPOILERS*******HIGH LEVEL: Vampire tale in the classic horror vein (pun intended). Atmosphere is ethereal and desperate.DO NOT read this if you are looking for a happy ending or a lusty romance. Think more Frankenstein than Sookie Stackhouse. DO NOT allow the plot description into letting you think this is another vampire love story or a Urban Fantasy take off of Pretty in Pink.CHARACTERS: Author uses a strange plot device in naming his main character ""Two."" I can only imagine that this was done deliberately to dehumanize her. It is jarring, to say the least, and serves to distance you from her throughout the book. I found myself constantly having to remember that ""Two"" was a person not a numerical reference. She comes across as two-dimensional, despite her trials. However, this was most likely the intention as it adds to the coldness of the story. The supporting characters are far more engaging, though the evil ""father"" is a true monster and serves only as a vehicle for evil. The best character is the tragic hero, Theroen, but be willing to have your heart torn out when you lose him.PLOT: Basic desperate struggle for love and acceptance- there is serious drug use, battered & abused women, whores, monsters, and other forms of desolation, loss and violence. This story is a tragedy and not one that shows any real hope. An attempt is made at the very end to indicate that Two will survive, but as your heart has been crushed, stomped on and scattered all over the ground by that point, it is too little, too late. There is a climactic point in the story that feels like the end, but then it continues and feels like a different book. I had a hard time reading past this point.BOTTOM LINE: This is NOTHING like your typical Dark Urban Fantasy and far more of a Horror. The images and events are brutal in their treatment of sex, women and life in general. I really, really didn't like it and would like to erase it from my mind, but this is only because it isn't the type of thing I'm into. If you are a fan of Horror and have no need of happily-ever-after, then you might like this.I have no recommendations that suit this book as it isn't my genre.",negative,book

9584,"This is the story of a detective and his new partner encountering a murder case.  The case becomes something much more than solving a basic murder when details come to light regarding people related to murder victim.  And it becomes an issue of solving more than one case and adding assistance from FBI and Navy.  The premise, while not a new one, has merit.  The specifics are predictible in some parts and there are no real twists to getting to the ""who done it"" and why.  However, that does not mean that many will not enjoy this version.  For many will.  Fans of true suspense crime novels won't find real depth found in other noted authors of same genre (Robb, Grafton, Etc.) - but is a fairly good attempt.The issues lie with presentation (style) moreso than premise.  The novella is riddled with errors related to grammar, punctuation, character development and presence, Point of View, and story arc development.Punctuation:  overuse of exhuberance (!) where illfiting at times, extra floating dialogue quotes at end of paragraph without dialogue, other than dialogue bits (some, not all) incorrectly punctuated, some dialogue missing punctuation related to tags, missing or incorrect punctuation.  Dialogue paragraphs with same speaker punctuated incorrectly (though very few will know such.)Formatting is still a bit of an issue as there are some pages where paragraph breaks are so many only two small paragraphs fit on page.  I do not include format issues in star rating as I know that (at times) formatting is amazon conversion issue from downloaning - rather than writer issue.  However, it appears as if the manuscript was originally typed double spaced and when hitting double return between paragraph breaks (which would then be 4 lines, rather than customary 2) there was an overabundance of spaces.  If that is case a simple full document conversion to single spacing prior to downloading should clear up format issues like that.Grammar:  wrong words used - corn rolls (should be rows) to describe ME hair, make on (should be one) take - there are several such errors - but you get the idea on that.  Past tense and present tense switches in sentences and paragraphs was frequent.  Some may be stylistic choice of writer and happens - but not with such frequency as seen in the work.  Some subject/verbs were not grammatically correct - plural nouns get plural verbs,  etc.POV:  I origionally was going to forgive the first few POV switches as character related fleshing.  But, when the POV for many of the characters switched between third person and first person (in same paragraph) I realized it was author error, NOT character voice.  It is possible to have a character think to self in first while rest of tale told in third - but only if the writer understands the fine line and can convey properly.  In this installment of series (in author defense this is first in series and she may have worked this issue out in later works) the author has no grasp of what POV she is using and how to use properly.  One POV is best for the whole work until such time as skill is developed well enough that conveyance and reading are not stilted for reader.Character issues:  Trace was intergral character and partner in training,  then he just (all but) disappeared about half way through book in order for the ""love"" plot device to develop.  Bob was FBI partner that was there for a blink, disappeared for the same reason as Trace, then popped in near end without adding ANYTHING to storyline.  It would have served better to leave Bob out and just send 1 FBI agent to work case as Bob did nothing but add an inconsistency to story line (detail on that next) .  Press was well developed and Trace fairly so (even though underused)  as was female agent.Inconsistencies:Chapter 11 - Press and Trace left interview with Moira - they climbed in the beater car and drove away...fine, until the reader turns the page and Press puts key in ignition, turns it and gets the smoke plume.Chapter 27 - title states day 4 time:  10 AM - yet the first paragraph has press and agent arriving at house ""that evening.""Chapter 28 - title states day 5 at 9:15 AM - Bob tells Rachel he will be in that night and see her next morning.  However,  he does not show up until day 7, several chapters later.There were more issues related to each listed, but you get idea.  I apologize for length, I write long - though typically not thus much.  However, I viewed a comment by author wherein she stated that a review was not really fair to those reading it (or to her I surmise) without specifics so she could fix errors.  Though some of the word issues and punctuation are not a big deal and frequqntly missed - the gross errors (POV and story arc inconsistencies) should not require reviewer intervention for correction. They should have been caught by writer or her editor as they are glaring.As stated in beginning, many will enjoy this novella. Though predictible and even with errors it is an okay read.  If there were not so many errors, I would have awarded more stars.Christine",negative,book
3159,"At first I thought I would really enjoy this novel and there are elements about it which weren't too bad - the magical parts - but the heroine spoiled most of it for me. She comes across as shallow and a real twit.I know she had to get into the woods to fulfil the story but getting drunk, deliberately running out in the middle of the night and getting chased by The Beast was just plain silly. It was reminiscent of those old-time movies where the ""feisty"" girl reporter is told not to go into the cellar and of course, the first thing she does is just that. Izzy, told not to go into the woods by just about everyone she meets, does just that too.The characters were not ""fleshed out"" sufficiently for me to have much sympathy for them - we know next to nothing about Feathers, the son, Connor, or his father, Joe (who turns out to be an elf) or the abusive ex-boyfriend/husband/partner. His threats and leaving mutilated animals on her doorstep is not taken very seriously by the police.There is no back story to speak of which would explain the circumstances of Izzy's life - a few letters to her rellies is all the reader gets. The ending was abrupt and the last chapter jumps forward a year without explaining what's going on with Izzy, Feathers and Connor. It's as though the author couldn't decide how to finish it and opted for the easiest way out.I abhore novels where animals are killed so that made me very distressed. It is not necessary and seems to indicate that the author has no problem with animal abuse. I may be being unfair to her here, but that's the way it came across to me.I would not recommend this novel for that reason alone.",negative,book

7215,"I am revising my review DOWN to one star, based on this author's responses to negative reviews, including mine. First he says he's not getting into ""a pissing contest"" with me, yet he had no trouble doing so with three or four other one-star reviewers (which he conveniently disremembers)...excuse me, one exception: He sicced his ""professional editor"" Sally Berneathy on Mr. Spadaro.Among one-star comments: ""reminded me of Nancy Drew...could have been written by a teenage girl,"" ""silly,"" ""makes no sense,"" ""dialogue is horrible,"" ""complete boredom,"" ""story is implausible,"" ""cheap and nasty,"" ""absolutely appalling,"" ""one dimensional as if a 13 year old wrote this,"" ""pedestrian,"" ""a first draft that appears to merit no further effort,"" ""bad grammar, syntax, punctuation...completely unrealistic characters, pages of pointless 'cute' banter that no one who has ever actually talked to an adult would dare call realistic,"" ""the text is simple, the plot is simple, the characters are simple,"" ""Moats should have paid me,"" ""who are these people that gave it a 4 or 5 star rating...I hope they don't live in my neighborhood,"" ""...even at this price (free) this book is a ripoff...who edited this? Someone's baby brother?"", ""reads like a dropout loser's fantasy,"" ""writing is usually sophomoric, at times schoolgirl giddy, and always bad,"" ""writing style is awful. Painful even. Lifeless sentences, tired descriptions,"" and Mr. Moats calls ME ""mean"". He also points out that he has legions of followers who applaud his work: I'm happy he has a large extended family.And the final nail: ""All of this combined with the rude responses to other Amazon reviewers by the author and I'm done with this guy for good."" AMEN.""Holy crap,"" he said, then put it between covers, titled it ""Classmate Murders"" and called it a book. I'm still not giving it a one-star because it DID improve. Somewhat.Let me get this straight. An 60-year-old, twice-divorced, unemployed (by choice, having determined his EMPLOYERS to be ""stupid"" and ""jerks"") car lot security guard who lives with his parents (supposedly helping Mom after Dad suffered a stroke but in return for a few chores and errands apparently gets room and board, gratis*) takes it upon himself to stick his nose into two murder cases simply because he went to school 40-some years earlier with the victims?And on what planet would a police investigator disclose pertinent facts of an ongoing murder investigation to - again, a 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents - AND cautions this uninvolved third party not to reveal said facts to the press? AND quick-as-a-bunny deem him an ""unofficial civilian advisor""?And the first thing said - again, 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents - uninvolved third party does is spill his guts about the murder (by now plural) and the ""closely police-guarded/ongoing investigation"" facts to his best friend, also - you guessed it - a (concealed-weapon licensed) automobile car lot security guard.Another sticking point: A smart, attractive, sexy 60-year-old semi-celebrity woman may have become reunited with a former boyfriend after 40-some years for some slap-and-tickle, but believe me - NO woman in such a position and still in possession of her mental faculties would completely ignore the fact that the former boyfriend - in 40-some years - had no higher achievement or aspiration than to become a - again - 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents.That's not suspending your disbelief, it's taking it out into a dark alley and shooting it point-blank through the forehead. That would have been more of a mercy killing than having, at long last, come to the end of ""Classmate Murders"".After reading 19% I had to go back and start over again to make sure I wasn't missing something. Tragically, I wasn't.On a positive note, a little further on the plot does get considerably more interesting. Whether it's interesting enough to overcome its unfortunate beginning and the foul taste left in my mouth from this unfortunate choice of protagonist ""attributes"" is up to the reader to decide.About the only thing I could recommend this book for would be as a classic study in character history and personality traits NOT to give your protagonist. Okay, he's a good guy, has a sense of right and wrong, is kind to his parents and hasn't kicked any dogs by the end of the book. Beyond that, as a general rule I don't require that a book's plot be 100% ""believable"" or even a remote semblance of real life. Still and all, THIS one was completely out of the realm of even MY sense of plausibility.To give Mr. Moats the benefit of the doubt I did read the excerpt from the next book in the series, ""Vegas Show Girl Murders,"" and while it might appear at first blush to be an improvement on 'Classmate', my sense is that the character hurdles enumerated at the beginning of this review are going to be difficult to bury. Still and all - as long as I can get ""Vegas"" for free - I will probably give it a try and hope for better things. For everybody.For those keeping score, here are the standings as far as heads-ups for most reviewers' declared turnoffs:1.) Profanity is present but not excessive;2.) No paranormal, supernatural, sci-fi, or magic components;3.) Little, non-gooey, romance;4.) No graphic sex (note the protagonist, ""has occasional sexual encounters, just not with another human being."");5.) Incest between half-sibs is mentioned;6.) No religious or alternative lifestyle agenda or promotion;7.) Some violence of a low-gory (but not grisly) nature, one non-gory incident of torture;8.) No cliffhanger ending;9.) Grammar and punctuation police, have at it, examples of what you will find:""She carefully taped the ends together and produced a nice spark."" (tape-ing would have produced noth-ing, tapping would have been more productive)""My curiosity was peaked.""""...but no one seems knows where.""*after all, the protagonist does confess to having split the money his MOM gave him for gas (for HIS car which is used primarily for HIS job) between the car's needs and his own need for BEER",negative,book

Many, many points in the story were completely unbelievable. I realize that it must be difficult to write a mystery, but I found myself thinking many aspects of this story were just too convenient.

9196,"Okay so all of the reviews for this are good, really good. that's why i bought the book. I normally dont like the BDMS thing, but when they are good they tend to be great. I did not feel this way about this book. The author takes the Dom/sub relationship way too far in this book, going into ""slave"" stuff. yuck yuck yuck.So basic plot line. Abused girl flees from an abusive jerk of a boyfriend, one who beats the crap out of her. She runs to the only safe place that she has ever known, her uncle's boat, only to discover two men living in a BDMS life and they have bought her uncle's boat. One man is an ex-cop, Sully. Clarisse doesn't trust him because he is a cop and the ""master"" in the relationship. and the other man, Mac, is the submissive. This is where I start to really dislike the book. Most of the BDMS books that I have read both men are productive in some kind of fulfilling life career. Not Mac. The whole ""slave"" thing really comes into play. All Mac does is clean the house and have sex. that's it. The men bring Clarisse into their home so that she can recover, saying that she doesnt have to participate. What??? If i was invited to someone's house after having the crap kicked out of me by a boyfriend and agreed why would you tell someone about your sex life. That would make me run in the opposite direction not toward it. it was really weird. Then as she grows to love the men, the men grow fond of her. Mac tells Sully he love Clarisse but will never leave Sully for her. Sully doesnt really admit his feelings at this time.It is kind of like Mac wants a pet of his own. So Mac tells Clarisse he loves her, but it is not really a full love because he belongs to Sully and will only ever belong to him. Sully will be the one to marry her but she is not at the same rank as Mac and if it came down to a choice Mac would win. I was more then frustrated. The men want her but I never really felt like they loved her. She really struggles with the D/s thing. I felt as though the men never really cared. They want to convince Clarisse that Dom/sub life is more then it seems but if she cant except it take a hike. But when she cant they want her to stay. To say I was confused is an understatement. So Clarisse is invited to several D/s parties, she grows to understand and except the lifestyle they are in. But she still doesn't belong to the men fully. Sully says no sex until they are married. But the weird thing is Sully and Mac did it all the time before they were truly committed with one another. Clarisse agrees to marry Sully, for the life of me i dont understand. He had not said he loved her at this point in the book. She just doesnt want to be alone, away from Mac. But Mac only kind of loves her. stupid.So after all the conflict and drama in the book's surrounding plot line (with the exboyfriend) she marries Sully. She wears both his and Mac's rings on her finger. Sully wears Mac's ring and Mac wears Sully's ring. The author makes a point to tell you this because even though Clarisse loves both men both men only really claim eachother.SO after saying all of that... I was down right annoyed with this book. YUCK!!! BDMS can be good. But when you dont have an equal relationship between the partners it is crap. I really wanted Clarisse to heal and then move out of their house. Mac for the most part only calls Sully ""master"" and then when she gets sucked into their lifestyle she does the same. Sully is the only one working and making money. Clarisse is the thirdwheel in this relationship. I hated that.I have read other books by Tymber Dalton/Macy Largo and they have been good. Sunset Hearts for example is wonderful.My advice dont waste your money.",negative,book

The hero from the past is sweet, but in a century where he would have been far more ""worldly"" about the opposite sex, he's unbelievably clueless about his sexual allure. Aside from that, the story is too disjointed to hold together or tie together, and the sex is so random and unaffectionate that it's hard to believe it would happen at all.

She seemed to speak as though she was out of touch with reality, then again, maybe she was. The story timeline is so off that I had a hard time distinguishing how much time had passed.

You know who the killer is almost from the very beginning. Even though the author attempts to throw off who the real killer is, it is a poor and lame attempt. The main character Tyler seems to gain super human strength and intelligence at times. If it wasn't for his ""intuition"" and sudden knowledge of things he had no previous knowledge of a few chapters previously, then there would be no way for him to ""solve"" the murders. The portrayal of the police is laughable at times. They're idiotic morons when the author needs them to be and super sleuths when he needs the story to move forward.

Plus the author doesn't consider the fact that alot of women, myself included, do alot of what she suggests anyway, and months, even years later, still have precious little to show for it!!! I can say all her wonderful affimations til I'm blue in the face, but is it really getting any of us, particularly single women, any closer to what we want??? Saying these things and believing them are all good and well but when you see 0 results from it, rather than being uplifting it ends up being disheartening. The overall feeling I got from this book is that the author believes that everyone who believes as she does and does what she does is 100 percent assured of getting everything they want, desire, and long for, which is NOT how the world works, particlarly in love or relationships. The author claims you don't have to change who you are or bend to get the results you want, but many a woman has tried this tactic, particularly in the pursuit of love and relationships, and still find themselves single.

Is it Glasgow, London, Manchester, a little fishing village in Scotland, I don&#8217;t know.So many of the stories failed to reach an ending or make any sense whatsoever. You&#8217;ve got one guy who starts the story by getting a right spanking off a few blokes, but we never find out why or what led up to it. He ends up beating a drug dealer up, tying his hands and feet together and then placing his feet through a pair of gymnast&#8217;s rings! How does he manage that when they&#8217;re tied together?

I think his writing is actually quite good but his plots are rubbish. They have little more imagination than an average schoolboy. They start out of nowhere, in the middle of a plot, and finish abruptly when the reader knows full well there&#8217;s going to be consequences for the actions taken at the end.Every story is incomplete.

I figured this would be a short, enjoyable story...and in all truth, it should have been.  It has the makings of a wonderful story, but it seems as if the author got greedy and decided to publish a skeletal outline for a quick sale.  There are too many holes, and it's simply too short to be worth paying for.  For instance, once he realizes ""Reva"" is a girl, he decides to hold her hostage instead of having her executed.  He tells her she has earned her next meal and better lodging, and then in the next sentence, suddenly it's 2 months later and they can't stop thinking of each other.  What?!  She's coming to breakfast, he's staring at her, and they've both fallen in love with each other during those 2 months, even though from what I can tell, they never actually talk to each other?  He still doesn't know who she is, and all she knows of him comes from people who live under his protection.  This is a huge fault, Jackie Barbosa.  You cannot expect the reader to believe they are in love simply because you say they are.  We need to see some sort of progression.  And then to believe that she, a strong woman who would rather face execution and surrender her family name, would blurt out that she's fallen in love with him when  he's her familial enemy?

I'll destroy anyone who causes you a moment of pain."" I cracked up. I don't think it was the author's intention but it was absurd that he professes his love and devotion after he attacks her and exposes her to the abuse by other men.

After a cordial conversation with Amazon, I cancelled the order - the Amazon print version is nearly 50% more than the same offer from the WSJ.

Lots of steamy sex, mostly anal as one reviewer noted. I don't have a problem with sex scenes if they are integral to the story, but there was no story.

He heads out to a brothel and for a number of months relieves his frustrations via voyeurism. His wife follows him one day and the Madame tells her that he has only been with himself but he is wavering. She suggests that the h disguises herself as a French whore with a mask and be with her husband when he succumbs to temptation. The h does so and the H breaks down in a big way. He cheats on his wife with his whore wife. After his first tryst, he is hooked and looks forward to each visit.

11897,"Welome to the negative review of the book everyone else loved.Let's begin shall we.I will start with the plot. When I was first reading the synopsis the plot sounded intriguing, and I loved the idea of the disgraced book hunter, and the lost Dickens story, but for some reason it ended up not working for me. I think that sex was introduced too early on, and was a distraction from what I liked about the idea of the book rather than something that added to the story.I liked James for the most part, and was able to sympathize with his plight. Losing the job he loved, and the security in his world must have been terrible, and, having worked retail, understand how frustrating, exhausting, and dehumanizing that can be. Added to the stress of trying to make ends meet on part time work without any sort of benefits, it's no wonder why he does what he does.Sedgwick, on the other hand, I never developed any affection for. I found him to be blunt to a point beyond simple rudeness, and his excuses seemed liked those of a child rather than a 42 year old man who should be old enough to understand proper behavior, or at least how to make a sincere apology for his words. I found his behavior, after he and James had a falling out, to be almost stalker like, and added to that he seems to almost bully James into hearing him out, and accepting his half hearted apology. He is also described as having a full beard, which is not my thing, and with all the scenes of both men eating had me truly grossed out imagining all the crumbs it must collect (this is not meant as a slight to any of my friends who have or enjoy beards, it's just not my thing.)For me the worst part of this book was the sex. This book had some of the hands down worst written sex scenes I've ever read, and let me tell you I have read some truly terrible sex scenes. Let's go to the book for some examples shall we.""Like a suede glove grabbing me, stroking me..Like a hot black fist.""What the hell is that supposed to mean, and why a black fist?""The pump and pull was like a hammer striking the golden frames of angel wings, pounding them into shining, glinting pennons. Perspiration sheened our bodies and our breath grew harsher as we bent our backs and worked the forge, and then the wings began to beat, trying to take flight, moving faster and faster, and we seemed to lift right off the ground, right off the pillows, and bedding, and hang there transfixed as warm, white Halle-fricking-lujah surged through.And then we dropped back to earth, wet, winded and weak. Human again.""Seriously what in the name of pink plastic ponies did I just read? I had to look up what a pennon was because I had no idea. Merriam-Webster was kind enough to tell me it ""a long usually triangular or swallow-tailed streamer typically attached to the head of a lance as an ensign"" which only made the sentence even more of a mystery to me because it sounded like the author was alluding to something that would be forged, like something made out of metal, say a sword, but the word he used meant something made of cloth. Color me confused. It's also some of the sappiest, most awkwardly written sex I've even read, and that's including the het 80's romance I read in high school. Nothing about this works for me on any level, and that's not the only angel reference during sex there is.""It was like landing on a cloud - with an angel on top of me. An angel that tasted like cinnamon and chocolate and stardust.""Really, exactly how old are these characters supposed to be because it sounds more like some child's fantasy of sex rather than real, adult sex. Sedgwick has some sort of whipped chocolate cr&egrave;me brulee body cream souffl&eacute; that only adds to my impression of them as much younger than they really are.My least favorite of the sex scenes has to be the one I included in my updates, but it bears repeating.""and it was sadly like a hood over the head of an angel, but better safe than sorry.The angel continued to blindly feel its way to the hot, candy-slick center hovering tentatively above it.There is nothing about that I find sexy, and ""candy-slick"" I guess I don't find candy to be very slick. I think of candy more as sticky which makes this analogy all that less appealing to me.In summary I will say I found the sappy, miracle ending to be the final straw. If things had been toned down quite a bit, and the characters' relationship allowed to develop at a more natural pace I might have enjoyed this book. Had the mystery of the Dickens story played a more significant role, and the sex scenes cut back I would have happily given this at least three stars. Alas this was not to be.",negative,book

388,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***I don't even know where to start, I had so many issues with this book.1. Feels like it was expanded from a novella length.  There's an over abundance of repetition, both in content and words (pu$$y, no, bred/breeding, essence, no, virgin barrier, beast/monster, no, c@nt, no, no...).2. World building is lacking, the MC's are supposedly not human (and the last of their species) but very little information is given...and what little we learn is not a plus (squicky courtship rituals and child sex).3. Back to the child sex elements.  Call it fantasy/dreams/alien norm, it's still disgusting.  I'm sorry, but there's no way to pretty this up and make it acceptable or attractive...but the author kept attempting to beat that dead horse.4. The Heroine. The reader is provided enough fodder to write essay on the many ways this heroine is not likeable.  By the 1/3 mark I had an overwhelming urge to just slap the brat, and by the 2/3 mark I'm actively rooting for the heroine to die so the hunky hero can move on and get himself a real woman. Her only attractive qualities are physical, and the poor hero is doomed to a lifetime if misery bonded to this neurotic, indecisive, self-centered, potentially psychotic, twit.5. ""C@ck Tease"" - Yet another unlikable heroine characteristic. This term was mentally flashing above my head in bright neon colors almost the entire time I was reading (eventually skimming) this book.6. Non-consent/rape elements mentioned in other reviews? Not really how I would describe it (see item #5).  There's a number of sexual situations where the heroine says no, the hero pressures for further intimacy, she says no again (and obviously doesn't mean it and encourages him again), more pressure, and she capitulates.  I think the author may have been aiming for a borderline non-consensual feel, but it fell flat.  And personally I found it all more annoying than titillating, but other readers may feel otherwise.7. Incest...where?  The MC's lived together for a few years as adopted siblings, over 17 years ago.  No blood relationship whatsoever, and given the time frame involved this didn't trip my personal incest squick.8. At least two elements I felt were given too much emphasis (bordering on OCD) were her virginity and the brother/sister relationship.  Heroine wrestled with this almost every page...ad nausium.8. There is sex in werewolf form, it you find this offensive...just another reason to avoid this book.9. The fiance...what to say?  This entire aspect of the story just didn't work for me.  Why was she engaged to this guy, why did he put up with her, she didn't plan any portion of her own wedding, she ended it very badly and he morphs into a sex criminal...WTF.Bottom line...my urges to slap the heroine were multitude.",negative,book

Ariel and Ral were recorded getting it on at the medical center... it was recorded and put on their form of internet.

Naturally this book is described as Erotic Romance and those examples were not appropriate.First off, this book is not romantic and it certainly was not steamy.  I saw no romance in this book until the very last few pages.  Other than that, the hero was strictly Master and seemed to take pleasure in the punishment.  He was not protective of her in that he made her ""get into position"", and a position that was very revealing for all to see her finer qualities who might be visiting and were allowed to touch wherever they wished while he watched.  It reminded me of the Story of O.  The entire book was focused on one aspect of her anatomy, and I hint at it in the title of this Review. There was no pleasure to pull you into the book to feel what she felt and to go ""OMG"" at steamy scenes such as books from Vivien Sparx.I have read much better Master/Submissive books wherein the Master was kind and considerate and eventually one could see something growing between the two such as love.  These Masters did not like the idea of someone else looking at her finer qualities let alone touch.  When I see the word ""romance"", I expect to see exactly that and/or something growing between the hero and heroine as the two work together in that sort of relationship.

Inexperience in the woman's body and in sex really gets to me.  If you are not grown up enough to know about this subject don't write about it.  Hell as a freshman in high school we were taught in our health class exactly how a woman's hymen works..  If one is female they should know this, if one is male and not old enough to know this they shouldn't be writing sex scenes.Next the in such a short book the sex scene should not span 12% of the book, for one scene.

She also sites the 2 hour distance between them as a reason why the relationship wouldn't work.  Uh...ok...all the while he begs her to give him a chance.  She refuses and demands that he leave her alone.  He does, but only because of a family tragedy.  She is understandably (NOT) upset that he does in fact leave her alone like she requested and decides to sleep with an ex without protection (her demand).  She ends up pregnant and again says she is the wronged party since Trey isn't immediately understanding that she spread her legs for her ex and got pregnant.

1058,"This short story is very confusing.I have no issue with unreliable narrators, but it is difficult to tell what is happening in this story because the writing is too poor for readers to be able to draw any conclusions.  Virtually everybody in the story has difficulty relating to others.  Conversations begin and then trail off without any important information being related.  The author doesn't prevent any ""normal"" interactions for us to be able to judge if the characters are the ones who have difficult understanding normal human interactions or if the problem actually is with him.  I had assumed that a main character was mentally unbalanced and waiting for that to develop throughout the story.  However, when the story ended, apparently he had become ""normal,"" making a very unfulfilling conclusion.  Why set up a ""weird"" situation for a short story with all this foreshadowing and then leave it unexplored and unexplained?  The only way the author can advance the story is to tell us -- in simple sentences -- what type of people the characters are (things like:  He was a nice person.  He liked people.  He didn't know why, that was just the way he was).  We're never shown anything through the action of the story.  People are just put in situations, have weird, trailing-off conversations, and then we're subjected to basic statements about the type of people that they are.The environment isn't very realistic either.  Because of some odd wording, I thought at first that maybe the story was set in another country -- but then a character mentions being from ""Michigan,"" which is the only sense of place we got in the story.  We know we're not in Michigan and we're in a city.  Don't hope for anything more specific.  It's a place where a independent office supply story is still in business (and can afford to pay ten dollars an hour for part time help) -- but is it in modern times?  Don't hope for anything specific, because it won't be happening.The characters seem not to know things that we would know.  For example, a character was in ""the war"" and has returned home and worked another type of job.  Later, ""old bruises"" on his face are thought by other characters to be from ""the war.""  However, human healing doesn't work that way and all humans should be aware of that.  Bruises, even ""old"" ones, have to be relatively recent and not from old trauma.The experience of reading this story is kind of like if another species was writing about humans and their interactions.  We know we don't act that way, but to a elephant, these interactions might make sense.The proofreading is better than some earlier reviews stated (I'm going to guess issues were corrected), but still not a professional job.",negative,book

2904,"Ok, let me start with the statement that I love ghost stories, LOVE 'em.  I am also not someone who throws a book down in disgust and doesn't finish it. I finished this book...read every stinkin' word, first with interest, then in puzzlement, progressing to disbelief.  My thoughts are as follows:1.  Not one, not two, but EVERY character in this story behaves in a completely unbelievable fashion (oh the little kid almost gets hit by a car then disappears into the cemetery, gosh, maybe we ought to look then call the police tomorrow if we don't see her, but ...gosh.. totally forgot about that.2.  There is no consistency between characters and scenes. None...at...all3.  Story lines are started, then completely dropped, with an entirely different plotline popping up.  Kind of like flipping channels on a tv, but with the same actors on screen...mostly.4.  If you are going to write about cemeteries, go to one.  Coffins do not litter the ground; those are called headstones or monuments.  Coffins are buried fairly deep, like 6 feet or so, not just under the topsoil.  The newly dead are embalmed and jaw shut before the burial, which usually takes more than..oh say 12 hours after she died on a plane...in another jurisdiction.  Oh,  and the puritans of the Salem witch trial era did not use mausoleums, particularly not for a victim of the witch trials, nor would you be able to just pop that coffin open and take a look.5.  If you are going to write about victims of the Salem witch trials, do some research beyond grabbing their names. i.e. their remains were not chained together and ""lost,"" they didn't all die the same way or in the same week. These were real people and an historical tragic event.  Either treat it with a little respect and research or make up an entirely different event.6.  Don't have the court say one thing, then act like the witch trials themselves, but have no development of that before sending minors to jail with no charges, but, hey, cell bars can't hold these girls anyway, huh?7.  Don't rip off Norman Bates and put him in a witch hat. Just don't.8.  Ok, minor point.  The plane ride from Vermont to Boston is not a long trip to the point of exhaustion for a teenager unless they got routed through dfw, but in your story it is one flight, you know, where the old woman with the portent of doom died.9.  Use a thesaurus.  Look up ""bragged,"" pick a synonym.  Repeat process for other words.10.  Oh, cell phones do work across state lines, and when the kid is trapped with a psycho killer, roaming charge be d***d. The state line thing was a recurring factor, thus a recurring irritant.  The phone would work, as would 911.When I started this story, it was with the attitude that this will be a fun YA ghost story; then I decided that it must have been written BY a kid, so don't be cruel or snarky.  After reading the blurb after the ending that the author is a columnist who has been published in several outlets, I decided to write this, my first negative review.  I usually just forget about it if I hate a book, never understanding people giving bitterly negative reviews to a free book; but this story is just badly written and badly researched (yes, you should do some research, even for YA fiction, maybe even, ESPECIALLY for YA fiction.)  Some of the free-form ""plotting"" could have been developed into a decent story - there were glimpses of what could be - but it just didn't happen. If your kids (or you) enjoyed this story, just understand that there are infinitely better ones out there, some that even have some accuracy about Salem and the witch trial, and, frankly, some that even make some sort of sense. Loosely tying together some creepy imagery does not make a story.",negative,book

Because of my enjoyment of that series I decided to read another one of C.L. Bevill's works.BIG MISTAKEIt is honestly hard to believe that these books were written by the same author.  Where the Bubba books move effortlessly through the plot, 'Dial M for Mascara' is a disjointed, tiresome series of idiotic dialogue and soft core porn.The endless nattering between the characters, especially between Mary Grace and her best friend is so idiotic and 'Shecky Greene' like that it becomes exhausting from the very start.It is supposed to be a comedic mystery, but the level of insipid disregard for the danger the title character is in makes it anything but funny.Many of the characters are clownish and one often wonders what purpose they serve in the story.I ended up deleting this from my Kindle at 70%.  I tried to hang on in an effort to discover who was trying to kill Mary Grace and why, but at that point I realized that probably everybody had a vested interest in snuffing out this airheaded, big boobed, shopping addicted, waste of flesh and I honestly couldn't have cared less who actually attempted it as long as they were successful.I think from now on I will stick strictly to the 'Bubba' books.",negative,book

1660,"I've been indulging in quite a few indie books lately.  Sometimes there's a gem.  Sadly, this is not one of them.The premise of Daughter of Deception is promising, and I was looking forward to discovering the different types of demons as Duke and Viola hunted.  I was unable to finish the book for a few reasons.1.  Like so many indie books, the lack of effective editing made it nearly unreadable.  I'm not saying responsibility doesn't lie with the author, but when you have an untried writer, a good editor makes all the difference.  Thorpe had many errors in tense, which became worse further into the book.  A sentence that made it past the copy editor: ""Viola shifted her grip on the knife's hilt, fights fought a wave of nausea..."" makes it obvious the author struggled with tense.2.  Her characters were inconsistent, so it was difficult to pick out motivations.  Viola expends a great deal of effort to get back in the Network, then quits after her first job?  She starts out self-assured and sharp, but quickly becomes something of a mess.  I wondered where the interesting heroine portrayed in the sample went.3.

2927,"I've read and liked a few stories from this author, but this series should be re-done completely for the ridiculous un-readable dialog that she strapped the O'Hagan family with. Her attempt to write characters with an Irish brogue is laughable (and not in the positive tickle your funnybone kind of way). My best friend (who is Irish by the way)said that it was by far the WORST representation of the Irish accent... and I had to agree.  Although I liked a few of her other books, this one is a complete let down. The idea was good; the only thing(s)dragging this story down is the dialog and the poor editing (which seem to be a problem in quite a few of her books). You are distracted by the type-os, and it just makes the writing appear rushed and sloppy--which I am sure is not the case.Maybe if she re-did and re-released this series, sans the Irish brogue....*I have the same review for all the books in the O'Hagan series.",negative,book

I usually like chick lit, so I wasn't expecting an amazing quality, just some amusement while on public transportation.

They intimate this is an old document that has value for historical purposes.

If he wanted us to accept his ideas he should have presented a more balanced story that included more detail about why the hero could be so strong; in particular his relationships with his mother and stepbrothers. His mad stepfather's vicious behaviour came out of nowhere; why would his mother marry a guy like this?

What I did not want and what gave me a tight, ""I can't believe this, I know this can't be true"" feeling in my stomach that ruined most the book for me was SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER the heroine thought the hero was her half brother for most of the book.  She kissed him and allowed him to fondle her although she thought he was her half brother.  Due to some plot device, she woke up in his bed, and of course he was so glad to see a beautiful woman in his bed in the morning, that he proceeded accordingly.  She did not immediately leap from the bed in horror and dismay.  The touching and arousal (!) continued until it was going to go one way or the other and *then* she got up.  All the while thinking he was her half brother.  This happened within hours of her meeting him.  It is not the only instance of them making out and basically doing foreplay while she thought he was her brother.

8845,"Updated from March 12, 2012 to fix typos in review.Let me start this review with a brief synopsis of the plot as that is lacking in the description.The heroine, Catherine is in a miserable marriage.  She is married to a baron who, based on the storytelling appears to be somewhat mentally abusive.  Her husband is an alcoholic and appears to have some emotional issues.  She is considered the most beautiful woman of her time and her husband likes to dress her as a strumpet when he has the occasional gentleman over.  The hero, Adam is an Earl who is ""lured"" to the castle for a pair of twin horses.  He meets Catherine and based on her looks, falls instantly in love with her.  The question to be answered is how can Catherine and Adam be together given that she is married?  Is it worth scandal for their love to blossom?As I read this book, I find several things incredulous.  First, this ""love"" between Catherine and Adam isn't really that well developed.  I can believe she loves him as she was forced into this marriage at 17 and has been secluded since that time, and Adam does not stare at her breasts that are so amply displayed by her husband.  He is kind and loving to her and teaches her about passion.  However, based on what was told in this story, I am at a loss regarding Adam's love.  Everything that is described sounds like the lust of a tremendously beautiful woman (think, Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, etc.).  I don't see how they had enough non-physical interaction for him to fall in love with more than her face and figure.The author shows Catherine as a sweet and compassionate person despite the lack of such she has received from her husband, but never directly to Adam.  Additionally, there was a scene where the men who were hoping to gain Catherine's favors (she never presented herself as a woman who would grant any) crashed another soiree when they learned that was where she was headed next.  I found this to be absurd.The villain of the story, Catherine's husband Edgar did not seem much of a villain once his story was told.  I would have liked to see more of his story early rather than later in the novel and if done right, perhaps I could have excused the adultery.Overall, I can't really recommend this novel unless someone doesn't care about infidelity.  I found this novel to be weak, the adultery aside and did not care enough about the hero and heroine.  Yes, I finished it because frankly, I wanted to know more about the husband and, was curious to know how the author would get us to the happy ending that is expected in these types of novels.  Despite the novel progressing to the point where Catherine and Adam could be together, the ending left a lot to be desired as well.  I will not be purchasing any additional novels by this author.",negative,book

Although multiple scenes from the original are incorporated into the text, you can really see where the seams are.  One example would be grafting a ""Three Company's""-worthy subplot to keep Elizabeth and Darcy apart.  Instead of the wit, wordplay, and charm of the original, we've got Elizabeth turning down Darcy's proposal because she thinks he's gay.  It isn't homophobic -- just witless.The plot, such as it is, is heavily reliant on action.  I found myself missing the acidic and pragmatic Elizabeth and Darcy more with every page.  Instead we've got these second-rate copies mooning over each other.

We don't know if she could have had any more depth because the author provided absolutely no worthwhile character development. In fact, what little information the reader is given about her made her very unattractive. She is materialistic, narcissistic and moody for no clear reason. The very first page clumsily recalls how she picks a fight with her husband over absolutely nothing.Sadly, the pitiful introduction to her hair is the entire basis of the book, although the synopsis held so much promise. The husband is just there so the story can have a male counterpart; he is quite insignificant. If he mentions it once, he mentions it a thousand times that he wants to get to know his wife of seven years. What?!?3. Why does this author (for lack of a better word) make them have their only serious conversations right in the middle of the awful sex scenes, not once but several times? Weird. Other than that, there is no meaningful dialogue between the two of them.4. Some of the informational points are repeated, over and over, and over again. Why?5.

Set in a slightly dystopian future,  most of the world population is gone,  and the world is divided into masters and pets.  So far,  so interesting.  However,  we get Jiri,  who is male,  but is completely female in all his characteristics, you could make him a woman and only change the pronouns and it would still work (or not)  So Jiri is beautiful, fragile, feminine, virginal and his lover is obsessed with his inexperience and jealous of any experience he may or may not have - which is such an old virginal set up,  and surely we've outgrown it. Then the entire plot momentum is about misunderstandings, which just grew old fast,  and Jiri bringing his mother's influence and good manners to the camp, civilizing the rough men etc...This is a wall banger for me,  I wouldn't recommned it to anyone and will never read it again.",negative,book

10206,"This book started out pretty well, but went downhill quite quickly.Unfortunately, towards the end, it feels like someone has taken a poorly-written attempt at all-out urban fantasy and smooshed it with an erotic novel, leaving the reader with a confusing mish-mash.Tina is a virgin, who bids on a very hot, masked man at a charity auction, expecting him to finally 'deflower' her (Tina's word, not mine!)He bails on their date, but promises to turn up at her house (Tina has never told him where she lives). She somehow decides to trust him, lets him, and they try to have sex.This occurs a few times. They try to have sex, and they try, and they try. Then, about halfway through the book it emerges that Mitch can't have sex with her because if he does, she'll be Lucifer's slave.Yeah.Oh, and Tina has been psychic all along, which is fine. Then, conveniently, upon learning that Mitch sold his soul to Lucifer over a century before, a very convenient fact about Tina's past emerges that will be everyone's salvation.This book could have been brilliant, if the writing was tighter. I won't be reading the others in the series.",negative,book

The book switches between first and third person narrative - in the same paragraph! You can't tell which character is talking or who they're talking to. The same thing with the tenses, mixing present and past - in the same sentence. It was PAINFUL.The truth is, there was some promise here. It's why I stuck around as far as I did. The characters were portrayed as being interested and involved in their own lives, with lots of hobbies. It makes a change from this type of alternate world scenario, where most characters are introduced as lonely, unfulfilled, etc. In other words, just waiting for the rescue. I would have liked to spend more time with this type of character instead, but I just couldn't stand it.I hope MacDonald gets some help from a friend willing to read this and offer instruction and suggestion in BASIC English.

I have read many conqueror books from 1066,and this book was like a comedy compared to this.  Not that there was  anything funny about this book, it just seemed like a poor attempt at writing a book about this topic from the author's part.  Perhaps as p as the author was trying to write a book about Norman conqueror's that was not the usual norman conqueror children as characteristics, and if that was the case, she failed miserably because norman conqueror's usually consummate the marriage ASAP after they are wed to the vanquished bride so that they have greater claim to the land.  But this norman hero seems to suffer from some ridiculous mental flaw, that he does the contrary, only because he wants her to care for  him first.  That's fine if  this this was a typical medeival romance book, but this is a norman conqueror who was given this land and bride as conquest.  This story was totally unrealistic for this era and I was really disappointed with this read.  I suggest that the author researches her history as for this particular era, then attempts to write a book about  and,make her next book about this era as nd the norman conquest more realistic.  I would not recommend this read to anyone who is accustomed to reading adveinturous, romanticNorman conquest books.  THIS WAS A JOKE!!!!!!",negative,book

Calvin, does indeed ""deduce"" that Brock is ""deeply closeted"" but nothing Brock does actually supports that conclusion. He's out to his ex-wife, his son, and doesn't bother to hide the relationship much at all. At the very beginning of the novel, Brock comes out to Calvin's property to give him an estimate on some repair work. Afterwards, Brock goes to a local bar and gets drunk, and inexplicably, Calvin is called to come drive Brock home when he gets too wasted. He directs several gay slurs at Calvin, but then comes back to Calvin's house and sleeps in the same bed with him! Moreover, he and Calvin literally jump into a relationship with no real development at all. Within a week, Calvin and Brock have not only professed their love for one another, but Calvin's given Brock huge amounts of money to solve his financial problems.As for the sex scenes, I commend Mr. Hunt because while Brock has ""sexy muscles"", he also has a ""paunch"" and in general, neither character is supposed to be a stud.A major ""con"" in this book is this: after several of the sex scenes, Brock and Calvin fart in front of one another, and then make comments like, ""Well, shouldn't have eaten the refried beans"" or ""I've just had a telephone pole up my ass"".

It didn't make me throw my e-reader against the wall, but I strongly do not recommend it.  Here's why:-The plot is extraordinarily weak, so much so that I felt nothing really happens in the book!  I could sum things up in 2 sentences at most, but won't for spoilers' sake.  This book was so predictable that it was almost insulting.  I scanned many pages in this book.-The H/h had no ""character"".  The Hero was 32 yrs old and had done nothing with his life.  He hadn't served in the military or taken his seat in the House of Lords.  After reading other books where the main men did those things or at least had some sort of accomplishments, I did not like this Hero, Adam.  He seemed lazy and lust-driven to me.  Literally, all  he did in the book was have sex with the heroine and fall in love with her.  All the action to resolve any ""conflicts"" was done by others or conveniently by chance.  About all I know about him was he was a devastatingly handsome and disgustingly rich earl who desperately wanted to bed the heroine.  That's it.-The heroine was beautiful, which is beaten into your head over and over.  She was in a bad situation.  I was a bit disappointed in some of her choices.  She seemed kind of weak.  There wasn't much to her other than her looks.-The story is basically about adultery.  Yeah, it happens now and did then, but I couldn't wholeheartedly cheer this relationship on.  And for the heroine to fall into it so easily did not sit well with me.  That seemed a bit non-Regency to me.

Wulf is the captain of a battle cruiser in the Prime military and Melina's mate(gemat for the male version). They of course meet and have an instant bond which Melina struggles against while they fight off several alien enemies and a home grown rebel force.I am not a professional writer by any means but I think my summary was more interesting then the whole book. It started out decent and then became the story of Melina constantly fighting and putting herself at risk which resulted in her getting hurt and then Wulf would show up after the fact to growl and rage and fuss over her....it was stupid. In one scene Melina is bleeding profusely, she can barely move, and a traitor shows himself in a room full of able bodied Prime warriors, but it's Melina who has to get up and fight the guy! All the warriors stand and watch, including Wulf, I was laughing it was so ridiculous. This was the theme throughout the book and the sci-fi elements came off as spouted nonsense. Here I can do it too, we are entering Helium Prime with four battle cruisers on our tail bearing 3.2 light years.......seriously!The author can put together a semi-decent sentence all though she would get names mixed up sometimes and you would have to stop to make sure who she was referring to, but the plot and storyline were awful after a third of the way through. The main steamy scene was forgettable, the whole book came off boring and corny.

It seems like the author wrote too much and it seriously wreaks havoc with the book. Most of the dialogue is exposition with a little character building shoved in wherever it would fit. From the situations that occur and the way they're handled most of the characters come off badly, with few redeeming qualities, and as awfully boring. I can't even remember their names.  As for the plot, what little of it there is revolves around a curse placed on the children of 2 families to cause conflict and a war, thus removing any responsibility the ""good guys"" might have in that horrendous affair. However most of the plot is shoved aside for world building, and while that may be fun for a bit, it gets old real fast. Another thing the more I learn about this world the less I want to read on, It is that unpleasant. There is nothing charming, magical or even realistic about it.

I found nothing respectable about her. The relationship the heroine had with her FBI partner was weird...was he secretly bisexual? The hero, who the author tried to depict as an alpha male was anything but to me.  The sexual tension between him and the heroine was so drawn out yet he continues to go out with other women to appease his mom when he supposedly has the hots for the heroine.  Nothing alpha male to me there! Also, I wasn't convinced of love after two sex sessions (which, by the way, were so uninspiring they should have been left out of the book).

The men all got along and shared her (HA! How unrealistic could it be?) and were very tender with her.  Yet, the language was coarse and out of place.  They all deliver ""their"" baby.  That's it.  That's the whole story.  What a waste of time to read!I read a lot and all kinds of books, but this was not for me.  There are too many actual good books out there to waste my time reading stuff like this.  Even if you like this type of book, I can't imagine liking this because there's nothing to it.

But its frustrating for the reader because the characters are put back to square one and repetition and redundancy ensues.A second issue, is that the world building is lacking. I don't understand the wolf culture. Neither the old ways or the new ways were explained. So when the twist happened and the wolves went back to the old ways allowing Zan and Brant to be together I didn't really feel an impact. And we don't get more about Zan's background until the end, and it wasn't that much. Lucas seems to be worldly and wealthy, where Zan only finished high school and works at a cafeteria and then a perfume counter. I needed more reasons behind the attraction.Another reviewer mentioned that Brant did not stand up for Zan. He let Lucas walk over him and her and their relationship. Brant did not layeth the smack down upon his brother when Lucas saw them having sex not once, but twice! And the second time it wasn't just Lucas who got a sneak peek! Un unh! And worse, Zan didn't call him on it.I really liked that this was an interracial PNR, but I wish I had known whether there were any other skin tones in the pack?

THIS SERIES CONTAINS REFERENCE TO, AND IN THE FINAL BOOK, AN ENTIRE STORY REVOLVING AROUND INCEST.This first book in the series is just basically an introduction to the series, and contained no reference to incest, but the second book did. I bought the other three books in the series based solely on this book, because I liked Sonny and Garron and wanted to find out how their story progressed. References to the incestuous relationship between Sonny's identical twin brothers starts in the second book, and through character thoughts and conversations, the author makes it clear that the relationship is long-term (going back to childhood), consensual, and accepted without a murmur by the rest of the family and apparently the entire town. I found this beyond disturbing, and promptly returned the entire series for a refund.After returning them, I went back and read the book descriptions more thoroughly, but beyond a vaguely worded comment in the description of the fourth book, none of them carry any kind of warning that these books contain sensitive or disturbing material. I did find references when I read all the reviews of the fourth book, but it should not be up to the readers to warn others about things like this. That should be responsibility of the publishers and Amazon. That even the fourth book, which deals directly with the incestuous relationship, carried no warning whatsoever is completely unacceptable.So I'm putting this warning on the first book in the series, before people get involved with the characters and their stories.

There was another ""man"" introduced as a possible love interest but he was not a serious contender just thrown in for I don't know why.  Where's the heroines father is one of the main plot points and yet she asks almost no one this reasonable question.  How is she supposed to find out?, she asks the ghosts in the house but in a round about way since she explains she doesn't want them to know how badly she wants that information!  What?  And so goes the story, I need to know this or that but I won't ask.  I'm mad or upset in some way but I will not say a thing, we'll go for a walk, we'll have some stupid conversation that is about nothing, I will fall down on top of one of the other characters, it's just too stupid to be suffered through.  Everyone knows that the heroine has some kind of ""powers"" but she hasn't a clue and NEVER finds out anything about them.  The hero is so all consumed with some angst that he can not say a single thing to the heroine that is not sarcastic and snarky and she is so stupid she can only say to herself well he's an ass but to him she either says nothing or something snappy like Hmpff.  Let's not forget to mention that she falls down every other scene if not every scene.  I have not read anything so awful since a few years ago when I picked up a so called romance where in the first chapter the dashing hero brutally rapes the heroine.

Theres a decided lack of character development. Theres not a strong story line. Theres the hero and heroine, theres the angst that draws them together while pushing them part. Theres the climax of the story that leads you to believe that for now all is well. As for the rest it goes from mild story scene to tons of adult content and not much else. It seems like the mild story scenes get you from one adult scene to the next. If you are all about paranormal Adult romance this is for you.

She was married to an abusive ""brownshirt"" (apparently it is 1936 in this story, but there is absolutely nothing to tip you off to that) who died.  Her daughter-in-law is a ""Druid"" and is reading her mind at all times.  The ""Druid"" thing makes little sense when you think the story is set in the present-day and zero sense when you realize the story is set in the 1930s.The plot is just pure silly wish fulfillment.  Minnie has low self-esteem and this random guy (her best friend's husband's best friend) just shows up, gives her a bunch of money for a quilt, and falls in love with her.  There is a brief hint of danger which is resolved super-easily.The male main is just too unrealistic, the reader is missing too much background information, and the character interactions are contrived.I do not recommend this story.",negative,book

She's a human adopted by a werewolf mother and human father. Her Uncle Omar, a were enforcer, loves her to death. She visits him each year for 2 weeks. This year she comes in the middle of mating heat for the weres. After she is almost gang raped by 4 weres, she is rescued by her equally shallow hero, Grady. Instead of Shannon being responsible for her own safety and well-being, she constantly whines about not knowing what is going on. Hey, ask Uncle Omar or at least pretend to listen to Aunt Minnie, Omar's girl friend, when she tries to explain everything to you! Please!!! And, as for Grady, it's mating heat time, so you know what he cares about! Even he whines the only time Mika takes a stand for herself-&#34;I want things like they were before,&#34; meaning a willing bed partner with no regard for anything else. Hey, and he won't &#34;mate&#34; with her so what's the big deal? Instead of the tension between the characters moving the story forward, it just became tedious. Even the over the top, let's have sex every time the reader turns the page became boring. I skipped most of the last half of the book. So, why did I finish it?

It was all over the place, constant name dropping, events taking place that didn't make sense.  I'm going to attribute the author being incarcerated as a reason that certain things weren't researched, then again, the male character dropped african knowledge on the lead character so some research had to be done, but not enough to bring the story together.  There was no character or story development, I didn't understand half the drama because it came out of left field and it wasn't developed enough to make you feel any kind of way.  The premise of the story is actually pretty good and so much could have been done with it but the book needed to be completely rewritten with the premise in mind to make it a good story.  It could have been one, but this author just didn't get it done.  This book was so bad I couldn't help but continue to read it just to see how much worse it could really get.  And it outdid itself.  I would say the author needs to read different styles of writing to come into his own, learn story and character development, like I said great premise but it could have been written a whole lot better.  Winny Williams? 'Back in the days'? A month past her due date to have a 8lb baby? Going to rehab for marijuana? It's a BUNCH of other things that will make you say, huh? And scratch your head.  The author possibly has a future, but much more practice is needed, you'd be okay with this book if the author was lets say between the ages of 12-17 and just started writting just because, handed in the manuscript with little editing and turned it into book form.

I understand that, when conversing with each other, people do not say ""I am"" or ""it is"".  They say ""I'm"" and ""it's"".  This is especially true in high stress situations.3.

In their search for wives and families of their own, the Beasts have created a pathway between their world and Earth and proceeded to kidnap suitable brides.The plot could have been fine and the typos can be overlooked. The gradual adaptation of the women to a new world and the heroine falling in love could have made for a great story if it had been treated with subtlety.What irked me is the blatant sexism and homophobia that permeated the story. The brides have to be pure (meaning virgins), they are mostly very young (sixteen) and deemed old enough to marry men twice their age. They're kidnapped and kept prisoners until they agree to marry. Those who try to flee back to Earth are punished (worse, the author even makes them like their punishment). There are many references to the fact that the men must be dominant and the women trained to obey and follow. Once kissed, they seem to loose what little reason they were born with and are enthralled with their kidnappers. The only things they require to stay are a) clothes and nice apartments and b)marriage and the wedding night.Homosexual practices are deemed against nature and disgusting.Now, I understand that this might be the view of some readers and I respect that the author has the right to her own beliefs.

The main character is an abused woman that doesn't have enough balls to stand up to her abuser, but will stand up to the man that has safe guarded her life.

But it begins with a short story called &#34;Big Pete.&#34; When that so-so story is over, it advertises ACCIDENTAL HERO with a short sample, for $4.99. Not a nice (honest?) way to promote. Nor did I have much identity with the hero of the novel. Then the author's propensity to overblown language is a put-off. Examples: &#34;Pale beams from a pregnant moon cut through the palm trees that lined our street.&#34; &#34;Dave Pendelton scraped me off the lawn.&#34; &#34;A thousand cockroaches skittered up my back as she studied my face.&#34; When writing a crime novel (unless it involves Elizabeth Barrett Browning), don't get poetic or stretch your figures of speech beyond breaking point!

These books, if you want to call them that, are novella legenth. So ive finished books 1-3 of this series in about 2 1/2 hours.  They are not master works of vampire fiction. They arent like the black dagger brothers, there lacks the feel of a seperate world, as j.r. Ward creates. Regardless of all of that, if you are waiting in line at the DMV, these are an enjoyable way to pass the time. They arent great, they arent all encompassing. Bur they are, well, ok.

6113,"All of her life, Alexandra Riley has wondered about her father and mother.  Growing up without her mother, her father was everything to her and they are very close.  However, there is one thing that Alexandra doesn't know, but before her father can explain more fully, she is swiftly taken away by the man that just tore her entire world apart - Joshua Striker.  It seems that Alexandra isn't just a normal, run of the mill young woman. She is the daughter of one of the most powerful Alpha wolves to ever exist and then to top off her already crappy day, it seems she is going into heat and no man will do for her what she knows Joshua Striker will.Alexandra's Legacy by N. J. Walters was entertaining but somewhat redundant at times.  Alexandra and Joshua were constantly battling the bad guys and I was often overwhelmed by their continuous fights and battles and the danger they were frequently in.  Alexandra's Legacy stalls somewhat while Alexandra and Joshua are trying to get out of town - it takes them at least two days to do so and I thought that was an inordinately long period of time to have to read about them running.  That said, I will be the first to note that Joshua Striker was loyal, brave, and very sexy.  His countenance and ability to protect Alexandra was noteworthy.  Their love scenes were hot and emotional, but somewhat scripted.  I never grasped the idea that they truly cared for one another and when that happens, I get so disappointed.  N. J. Walters' writing style shines in Alexandra's Legacy, but I just didn't like the constant danger mode of the entire book. I wanted Alexandra and Joshua to be able to unhurriedly fall in love and that just didn't happen.TaliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",neutral,book

5644,"I read this short story because of its authors. Both are great authors and the story had potential. Unfortunately, while a good read, it doesn't live up to its full potential.A driver picks up a hitchhiker. Kills him. A hitchhiker is picked up by two stoners and kills them. Third chapter: The serial killers meet and all hell breaks loose.Except that hell is a little bit predictable. But graphic.I had to read the story twice. I didn't read the description or advance marketing copy before beginning the story so I was not prepared for the POV shift in the second chapter. It confused me until I went back and read it again. The cliffhanger from the first chapter appears to lead in to the second chapter quite naturally, but the POV shift was a shocker until I understood how the authors collaborated and who wrote each part. After that, the story made better sense. That's probably my fault for not reading the promos.Still, the writing is not completely terse. There are parts of it that can be tightened. Adverbs where none are necessary. Sentences that could have been shorter. But these are nitpicks. The plot and story line are actually decently implemented.The problem is the authors could have spent a little more time on the collaborative effort in chapter three to make it more unpredictable. Some of the characterization is a little flat even for a short story. Otherwise, I'd say it was a decent read.Doesn't quite deserve four stars, but it's better than three stars. Probably more like a 3.8.",neutral,book
6402,"This is the 3rd book of the Out of Uniform series by Elle Kennedy. I have really enjoyed this short series so far, but this one would probably be my least favorite. This is the story about Will and Mackenzie who have been friends for over 15 years and Will has been secretly in love with her all this time.  Mac thinks of Will as her best friend, someone she can count on and that won't leave her.  It is safer for her to keep him as a friend instead of becoming involved with him.  One day, she kissed him and for Will, that was the day there was no turning back.  He had to have her and had to convince her he was the man for her, that he loved her all this time and that he was tired of waiting around for her.  Mac has a special ability, where she sees the future.  She has seen images of Will and her and knew in her heart they would get involved and when they did, oh man, it would be hot!  After their explosive night together, will sees images of Will falling from a helicopter and freaks out.  She didn't want to continue the relationship because she feared if she did, she would lose him so she pushed him away.This one is not my favorite from the series, probably because I thought the main characters were not that interesting, but the story was nice and short.

10896,"The predominant issue with this book is the editing.  Just about every sentence is a run-on sentence.  I tried to ignore them, but reading them is the literary equivalent of tumbling down a hill.  On one page, the average sentence was five or six lines long -- all joined together with commas and very difficult to follow comfortably.Putting aside the editing issue (which I know the author is aware of, but hasn't yet fixed), the novel would be 2.5 or 3 stars.  The basic premise of the book -- retired police chief from Wisconsin helps solve mysteries in Palm Springs -- isn't bad, but the actual mechanics of it leave some questions.  I need more back story to help me understand why a small town police chief would have the ability to be especially good at solving these mysteries (the story of him just being a ""natural"" at profiling and even doing freelance profiling for the F.B.I. didn't ring true).  We never really saw Henry being good at figuring things out or having special insight into people.  He just sort of talks to people and the mystery solves itself.  It was kind of like watching your grandpa solve a case -- not a detective grandpa, but just your regular grandpa.I also had lingering questions about the plot.  The device of the autographed pictures didn't make sense.  I don't understand why somebody would be more likely to buy a house if there was an autographed picture of a celebrity in it . . . either you're an easy mark for that sort of scam or you aren't.  What was the picture supposed to convey -- that the celebrity had left an autographed picture of themselves before moving out?  It also didn't make sense that nobody on the police force wanted to solve the crime because they'd heard rumors that the victim liked to have sex with teenage boys.  Detectives can't just opt out of murder investigations -- they may do a halfway job, but they can't just call in a local volunteer.I give the author credit for attempting to create some characters that add life to the book.  Wayne and Henry were too alike to be distinguishable -- they need to be able to play off of each other better if this is going to be a successful series.  Charles was actually an good character and I can see the potential there.  It was jarring to have him continually introduce himself with ""Heeey,"" when no other dialogue had any sort of spelling alteration to imply dialect.  It was distracting and unnecessary.  The character of Amit was interesting in that you could see the author's attempt to surround Henry with characters who were very different -- Amit was young, of a different race and nationality, technically savvy, and very different in personality.  Like the vast majority of the dialogue, Amit's didn't ring true, but with more work and development (in dialogue and character), I can see this being a solid group and am hoping maybe Amit is being set up as a regular character.This has the potential to be a good series.  It isn't there yet, but I would check out future books if I felt the author addressed the editing, tightened plots, and focused on characterization.  I think there is room in the mystery world for a detective like Henry.",neutral,book

3246,"I pretty much enjoyed this story.  They met on an orgy cruise, had sex without knowing how the other looked, and was hooked.  Surprisingly this story was well developed with the characters.  Kind of got tired of the female always bringing up her weight, though.  It was refreshing when he didn't want a 'relationship' with her and had the nerve to be upset when she didn't want one with 'him'...she wanted more and walked.  Some may not like the way she became conniving and went out of her way to make Troy jealous, but in the real world men do need us to show them the way, so they can be happy.

1351,"I found this books to be quite enjoyable. The main character was drawn quite well and seemed to be a real person, rather than some two-dimensional character. I liked the fact that unlike most fantasy heroines, she isn't a young miss. She is the mother of two teenaged sons and a devoted wife of some years. She had a history and a background upon which to draw from.In this book, her husband has gone missing. Rather than accept the inevitable, she gathers up her courage to go look for him. At no time does her personality undergo a radical change where she is suddenly in possession of unique fighting skills or magical power. Instead, she muddles through as best she can, much as anyone else would. I think that it is this touch of ""realism"" that helps to make the book. The events are low key and very believable - for a fantasy book.",neutral,book

10809,"If you are looking for a serious story, steer clear. This one is pretty ridiculous and silly. Yet, I found myself laughing at some of the situations these folks got into and the witty dialogue. I liked it for the simple read that it is. The writing is good I think it was the author's intent for this to be campy.Rebecca's transitions were plain ridiculous. After spending a lifetime under her father's thumb, she wants to be bold and colorful. Yet she could never think of repurposing her Madam aunt's whorish dresses into something a little more demure to find a happy medium between her and her man. The 'chickens' figured that out for her. I enjoyed that she snapped back at Lucy of the Bible Brigade.Sexy Sheriff Adam is fairly one dimensional (would have like to get some history about him) and their romance was really non-existant. They were hot for each though. Particularly after she offers her virginity to him. Well, it's either that or auction it to the highest bidder now that she's the owner of the whorehouse. To keep law and order he's always threatening to shoot someone. And actually does it a few times.The villain was just tossed in, I'm convinced, to be the Snidely Whiplash of the story.

11184,"bodyI picked this book up as a Amazon freebie.  Now is the time to read all the holiday feel good stuff, so I thought it would be a nice change of pace.  This was a super fun, light holiday read.  The story was ""A Christmas Carol"" revisited.  Daphne dies back during Vietnam. She feels she has died to early so she bargains with an angel to be sent back.  The Angel Council agrees and send her to help Nat become a better person.  The trick is that he sends her to the future, ie. Present day.  She ends up helping the son of the man who she saved when she died.  As expected, Daphne falls in love with Nat and vice versa all the while he is changing his perception of things as they look at his past and future.  These scenes come through differing electronics, like a TV, a PC monitor, a copy machine plate...the author did a good job of incorporating the ""The Christmas Carol"" from a modern day point of view.  Nat was very damaged goods. As a child, his father ignored him and he learned better not to feel than to be hurt.  As young adult, he found that the woman he proposed to didn't really love him for him, but for his money...so from that he learned that women and men use each other, nothing more. Like the original ""Scrooge"", he thought money was the most important thing. Not family, not friends and not Christmas.  He yearly fired people on his staff at Christmas time, boy he was a downer before.  As they looked back on different parts of his life, he started to realize that he was seeing things differently than he did previously, thus changing him.  Daphne was changing him.  But Daphne's job was only temporary, she was expected to move into a new body and continue her life, with no recollection of Nat.  Us readers already know what will happen, but it was nice reading it anyways.  Just a nice feel good book. It was a little shorter than the books I am used to reading, but I felt that it was well paced and if felt like I got the full story.  On a side note, I must say the way the author spells Nat is odd to me...I'm assuming its pronounced like Nate, sine the guys name is Nathaniel.

2383,"Just like several other reviewers of this book, I had to walk away from reading it several times before I could get it all down.  (And I have a seriously strong stomach for violence.)  This is rape.  There's no other word for it.  I've recently started reading BDSM books after never having gone beyond so-called ""bodice-rippers"" in my 63 years.  Flat-out rape is a legitimate plot device, but I find the conversion of the victim into a willing wife to be offensive. She fell into the hands of a predatory stalker, and she got gang-raped by him and his employees.  To have her then succumb to his manly wiles just makes her look stupid, on top of that.  I had thought better of the author.  I read Harlequin novels in 1976 where the ""heroine"" fell in love with her rapist and married him, but generally, those were written for very stupid women.Apparently times have not progressed much.  I've read a number of BDSM books lately where the characters are interesting and well-written, and where they make rational decisions based upon the actions in the stories.  Once she stopped biting the head rapist here, I stopped believing this story.I also second the mention in another review that the description of the device they built to hold her was inadequate.  Readers are not incapable of visualizing a device, if the description is clear.  In this case, it was appallingly unclear.  The author might as well have just said that they were using magic wands to hold her and move her around.  Additionally, I was greatly concerned with the eventual use to which the pictures of her were to be put.  It is all well and good to say that the five rapists ""love her"", but the pictures they took and posted on the wall of screens could both be used to destroy her career, and to send them to prison for years, had she chosen to be litigious, as she should have.  It kept distracting me from the story, every time that wall of screens was mentioned.  (What can I say?  I used to work in a law school.)The author is an intelligent woman.  She writes well, and she spells well, and she punctuates well.  Her prose is clear (although not her description of that device).  I gave her an extra star for having paid attention in English class.  And at two stars for content, I was being generous.  Rape is appalling, but understandable.  Falling in love with the rapists, all five of them, is not.  The other reviewers have mentioned the victim's deeply-hidden desire to be loved, and her Daddy issues.  More cliches.  Rape is rape.",neutral,book

There was something off about it. I think the biggest problem I has was the h, she seemed to piss me off. I'm not sure if was her attitude while she was ""kidnapped"" or after she come to accept her life. I guess she came off as bitchy through the whole book, and not in a good way.Also, I think that toward the end the book was skipping several months, then years. The whole someone trying to kill her, taken a back seat through the whole book, then was resolved in a matter of pages at the very end.The sex was a little boring.... except the whole Ryan and Phillip scene, that was hot.This book wasn't the worst I have ever read, but it definitely was worth the money I paid.",neutral,book
2444,"The Thinking Machine is--well--mechanical. Talk about formulaic writing! Professor Van Dusen (AKA The Thinking Machine) is an insufferable bore.

Ah, logic triumphs over all!If you are looking for character development, you won't find it here. The professor is unidimensional and not the least bit endearing.

4254,"I like the professor/student theme well enough and like to read erotica/BDSM fiction so I figured this would be sure thing, but I was so disappointed in this.The premise is totally cliche, the student comes in looking to better her grade and they get into it.  Technically he does assign her some reading and asks questions, but only while he's touching her.  He ups her grade, and supposedly unrelatedly, they agree to spend a weekend together where she is his love slave.My biggest problem with this book is that the dude is so freaking angry over his ex-wife and he's taking it out on her.  The BDSM angle isn't so much about being in control or giving her something she needs, as it is about keeping his distance from her and taking out his anger issues.  Really, BDSM should not be about hating women and trying to prove something, and I found it really ugly.  Even the love scenes, which were only medium hot anyways, were ruined for me because he kept demonstrating such ... immaturity.  I do like a man to take charge, but if he ends up acting like a baby when he's doing it - that is not hot.  And she stays through it, which doesn't make me think too much of her, and then when he decides she's proven herself and stops acting so angry, she just accepts it gratefully - geez, where you're pride, girl.My second problem with the story was the whole grades/morality issue.  It is bound to be an issue with any professor/student relationship but you can work around it, or at least feel some guilt if you want me to feel sympathetic toward the character.  Instead, the professor goes on about how he really liked her but he couldn't approach her because it wouldn't be ethical - then when she approaches him, he totally goes at her, hard and fast - yes, very ethical you are.  The dude just seems like an immature jerk and the girl is pathetic, but at least she is young as an excuse.YOU MIGHT PREFER...Holiday BoundJulie's SubmissionPromises - Promises Linger",neutral,book

""The Knife's Edge"" is a mixture of erotic romance, powerful suspense, and some added dark elements. The characters we're interesting and well developed. Another short story that comes to the mind that had similar character development isThe Mist Of Remembering: Erotic Romance Fantasyby Sandra Ross. However, this story had more of a dark tone to it that is satisfying to read.In ""The Knife's Edge"", you follow the interactions between two people, the beautiful and brave heroine Nestra who is the Queen of the realm and her trusty advisor Dardanus. Dardanus is an intelligent, devious character that has a dark secret that you will soon find out about him. This story is rather short so I don't want to tell you more otherwise you wouldn't get the most out of it. All I can say is the ending will definitely surprised because of the brilliant plot twist that the author, Stephanie Draven has implemented.You won't be disappointed if you love stories with a mixture of romance and suspense.

However, even though parts of series and more could be related for knowing previous - I still believe the stories I have read in this series can stand alone.  Which I prefer as I hate to be beholden to reading serial type works.

The tale unfolds as Argus and his co -worker and roommates try to figure out what the package contents mean and why/how related to Argus.  Again, this author shows creative abilities with his premise and the pieces that seem random - but ultimately tie together.  This one is related to a supernatural place and supernatural events.  As is the other one I read (likely all four are).  The supernatural bits are not overdone or ""hokey "" to this reader and while it seems to jump around a bit - I believe this is due to various people working their part of the puzzle and author intent versus just jumping around without cohesive plot planned.I really enjoy reading this author's work. I just find the numerous grammar and punctuation errors distracting and reduced the rating one star for such.

3410,"With Beg Me, I just don't know what to say. I am really disappointed with this story. I happen to love stories with rough sex, forced sex, or rape roleplay. So I knew this part of the story wouldn't bother me at all.The heroine does like it raunchy with some dirty talk like 'hot bi***' and 'dirty slut.' I love this. I also love the bondage and domination both characters are into. Even the heroine's recent traumatic past didn't upset me, at least not in a bad way. I was prepared to feel sympathetic toward her. So why didn't I like this book then?Despite having all the above elements going for it, this story was just flat to me, very one dimensional. It's a pale imitation of every good/great story with the same themes. Yes, some parts of it were sexy, but the story was so deficient in other areas.I didn't dislike the heroine but I also wasn't that into her at first. Then she became unlikeable to me. The way she treated the hero, by making him do something he really felt sick at heart about; that just really ticked me off. So given what she's been through, this justifies her right to tear him up inside in order to make herself feel better? Sure, she wants to take back her sex life, but the disregard she showed him annoyed me. The man would do anything for her, and she asks him to do the unbearable. The guy's practically sick to his stomach, but it's ok as long as it makes her feel better? The h comes across as weak and selfish.Other parts of the story were just as annoying: the overdrawn mother-in-law character, the h's absolutely ineffective confrontation with MIL, the H's watered-down manhood (I mean, the h virtually turned him into a punching bag for someone else's transgressions), the poor editing, and the overall unsatisfactory storytelling.The hero was the only slightly bright spot of the story and even he couldn't save it from itself. He had his moments but not enough to offset the actions of the heroine.To me, this is just not a good read, not even an okay read.If you want to try a good story with some of the same elements but with some really thought-out characters, maybe sample these -Willing Victim(rough sex, rape fantasy, domination)Helene Blackmailed(rough sex, forced sex/coercion, domination)On the Edge(rough sex, domination, menage)Demon's Captive(rough sex, forced sex/coercion, domination)",neutral,book

5121,"This is one of my least-favorite books by Harrington. It wasn't bad--even Harrington's 'bad' would be better that most authors' 'good'--but A Light For My Love didn't grab me and hold my attention the way her other stories have. I suspected it was one of her earlier works, and I was right. Still, Homeward Hearts, released before this, was quite good.The writing is professional and rich, and the characters are well drawn. The problem I had with A Light For My Love was the fact that the plot seemed to drag in places and the heroine was irritating at times. I got as frustrated with her as did Jake.There is also a scene in which the heroine has information about something, but chooses to wait and look at a confirming characteristic at a later time. (Sorry. I know that's vague...trying not to be a spoiler.) I didn't buy it. In her place, I would have looked at it as quickly as I could. The author should have had Jake leave out that piece of information and then have China discover it later, on her own. The detail in question would have been self-explanatory, and it would have ramped up the emotion in one of the final scenes.Bottom line, this story is in need of some tweaks and a good trim.

Tension is well built. The impending doom of a battle is clear in the language. The author does a comendable job of creating the rules for the ensuing battle.There is an inflection point where the mages are introduced, the story goes south for a number of paragraphs. The word mage is repeated a lot. The repitition is abrupt compared to the introductory paragraphs where the author chose words very carefully with little repetition. More fantasy words are used and then it becomes clearer, this is real battle combined with a fantasy land battle. Although I hesitate to say fantasy, because this could also be viewed as how Marten copes with the horror around him; although not real, he sees the mages, zombies, and dragons as if they are real.Fortunately the story recovers very nicely and flows into a comprehensible and vivid description of the battle. Once the author settles into the type of phrasing from the early paragraphs, the story regains its power.This is an interesting blending of styles, historical and fantasy. Aside from the transition point, a very well written, visual account that is an engaging read.",neutral,book
3655,"My biggest problem with this book is that I liked both Sam and Marabeth better at the beginning of the book than I did at the end.At the beginning of the book Sam is a protective but sexy alpha male.  By the middle of the book he's extremely controlling and is playing little headgames with Marabeth that make me want to kick him almost as much as she wants to kick him.  And by the end of it, he's more than controlling, he's also patronizing.At the beginning of the book Marabeth is a strong-willed woman who has an unfortunate attraction to a man that she doesn't want to be attracted to.  In the middle of the book she's fighting for recognition from both her father and her soon-to-be husband - not just recognition, but respect.  She's fighting the good fight, demanding answers, working on projects for the good of the country and insisting that Sam stop treating her like a child and that he respect her work.By the end of the book she has given up everything to him.  She's incensed about how he doesn't listen to her, the fact that he's pursuing a project directly opposed to one of hers, and his constant patting on her head and acting like she's bubblehead... but as soon as he admits his love to her who cares about all that?  Hey, he said the L word... all those other problems? Big deal?!  We never get to see how they work out any of those issues, what happens with their conflicting projects, or whether Sam ever starts treating her if she has any brains.  The story is over with as soon as she knows what his feelings are towards her.Well you can love a dog, but that doesn't mean that you'll treat it as your equal.  Since that was what Marabeth was fighting for the entire book it was pretty upsetting to me when she surrendered in the ninth round, apparently not caring that none of the issues she's constantly pushing Sam about have been addressed.  I hope she doesn't expect him to change into a caring man who respects her opinions and ideas after the wedding, cuz he didn't even compromise about that before it.",neutral,book

1817,"I readThe Naughty Little Tower Room: Erotic Romance Fantasyand was looking for another great, sexy romance novel when I stumbled across this book. This was definitely what I was looking for. ""Bonded by Need tells the sexy, erotic story of a trio of characters who simply can't keep their hands off each other. At least the men can't seem to keep their hands off Jayda. Jayda is a polymorphic shifter, which means she can transform from a human to a wolf or a cougar. She's recently moved to a new town and is now meant to marry the head of the wolf council.Jayda and the wolf council leader Cole are bonded together and destined to be married. The wolf part of Jayda is happy for the connection and Jayda hopes that all of her can be satisfied by the relationship with Cole. But her cougar side is crying out for someone else. That someone else just happens to be the head of the cougar council, Zane. Both men are obsessed with Jayda and can't seem to stay away but can either one actually satisfy her completely?Cole wants to be life mates with Jayda and believes that he is the only one for her. But Zane can't resist the seduction Jayda employs to try and get him for herself. Jayda wants both of the men but can she really have them both? Everything is starting to change as more and more people are killed and Jayda will need to make a choice before someone else ruins everything for good. But can she really choose between the two different sides of herself? And can she choose between the two men who both promise to satisfy her so well?This book is a great story about how one woman can be torn in more than one direction. I think Jayda is a character that nearly any woman could relate to since she seems like she's in a struggle between herself to choose which mate will be the best for her. This is a lot like just about any woman who is trying to make a choice that could prove to be incredibly important to her as time goes on. The two male characters are each hot and amazing in their own right and you'll be rooting for each of them by turns as they show their true colors and their true feelings for Jayda.This book is a great story about romance and love as well as involving some supernatural elements in the form of the shape shifters and the things they have to face in order to make their way through life. If they don't make some decisions quickly, decisions will be made for them and the results may not be good at all.",neutral,book

The chemistry between the two characters wasn't even believable, but even that was ruined by the crude description of what develops between the two of them. It was like two teenagers in heat. I found myself wondering what happens in the end, there was no closure to the psycho ex- boyfriend. The content was lousy. Thank goodness this book was free.

602,"Dealing with testy moral issues like assisted dying and euthanasia is never easy - but the story weaves these together with compelling arguments for and against in the guise of a tale that begins with a Grandmother's letter to her dropout net-surfing journalist-wannabe grandson and pits him with (initially) and then against his new romance; a human rights activist who turns out to be the very kind of person that the inventors of the Death Trip want to be rid off.Dealing with how society sees the burden of care being paid for and dealt with - our main character Chuck is torn between blowing the story of the big evil Pharmaceutical Company that wants to euthanise the undesirables and prove the activist right, or believe the softly insidious entreaties of the idea behind the science and the advances of the owner's daughter, with whom he has a torrid affair.A good story that walks the line between the issues well but does have an almost deliberately rushed ending, as if a Sequel was the obvious answer - I would still definitely recommend the Author.",neutral,book
8525,"I nearly didn't buy this book because at least two reviewers said the heroine was annoying. One quoted the heroine saying the room felt ""embarrassed"" because of a minor imperfection in the flooring. I thought that sounded quirky and since I'm known to be a little quirky myself, I decided to give the book a try. I'm glad I did.The story is well-written and entertaining. For the first time in a romance story I got irritated by the make-out/sex scenes because they were interrupting the story and I wanted to see what would happen next! Even though it was quite obvious to me who the villain was, I still wanted to know how the person would be discovered and what the consequences would be. I was a little impatient with the characters--especially Ellis--for being unable to guess the person's identity, but I guess Ellis has a blind spot as she likes to believe the best of others.The unmasking of the villain turned out to be a bit of an anti-climax, though. When incidents escalate, the police are called in, but we are never clued into what is going on with the investigation. One day the police are interviewing our hero and heroine, then a week or so later, the police turn up and arrest the villian and cart the person off the premises. We are not even allowed a glimpse of the arrest scene, so there just didn't seem to be a strong enough resolution to the whole mystery, even though we know who did it and why it was done.As for the romance between Simon and Ellis, it was satisfying to me. I thought she was a little eccentric where her work was concerned, and a bit of a perfectionist, but not unreasonably demanding. Simon's a hard-working guy who takes pride in the work his company does, and he recognises that same element in Ellie. So, while he may get exasperated with Ellie's requests, he doesn't hold them against her. The two of them fit together quite well. I thought the author was going to get Simon to meet Ellis' family, since Ellis' mother was mentioned, but that didn't happen. A pity, because it would have been great to see them get together outside, away from the whole construction/interior decorator setting. I do agree with another reviewer that Simon shouldn't have flirted with Cynthia but I think he wasn't sure how to extricate himself from her when she cornered him--and being that I'm a woman and I've seen how some women can be, I can find it in myself to feel a little sorry for the poor guy!Overall, I liked the story a lot and I would read other works by this author.",neutral,book

2331,"~* 3.5 Stars *~It's innocent, if slightly indecent fun. About as indecent as the shy and a little uptight Hailey Jennison gets, actually. She and her friends get together every Friday night for some very specific girl time. Gathering around the window in her friend's apartment, lights off, snacks and drinks in hand, they look out the window and down into the apartment of the man they refer to as Mr. Tool.The man is smoking hot and has a habit of walking around his apartment barely clothed, sometimes not clothed at all (and aren't those happy nights!), with his lights on and his shades up. Hey, a girl's gotta grab whatever salacious fun she can, right? It's harmless and he's the man of her dreams - literally. Then she goes out to get some more booze for the girl's night and Mr. Tool confronts her about her and her friends' weekly activities.Mr. Tool...Gage for those who actually know him as more than just a bit of man candy, gives Hailey an ultimatum. Either she goes out on a date with him, or he calls the cops and files a complaint about her and her friends' weekly peeping.For six months Gage has been hoping for a chance with Hailey. She had moved out of the complex before he worked up the courage to talk to her, but he caught her and her friends spying on him one night and has gone out of his way to make sure she has plenty to see ever since. True, blackmailing the woman for a date isn't exactly the most gallant thing he's ever done, but it got the job done. Finally. Now, if he can just manage to get through the date without opening his mouth and sticking one or both feet into it.To say Gage is socially awkward around women would be a gross understatement. It makes starting a relationship hard, especially when he is as attracted to a woman as he is Hailey. A little blackmail seems a small matter for his pride, though, if it gets him a shot with Hailey.~*~This deliciously erotic little bit of yumminess was fun for a hot, quick read. The plot was a bit light, and I'm not sure I bought the whole gorgeous-guy-has-to-blackmail-a-girl-for-a-date concept, but the characters were likable and the sex was abundant and hot. Sometimes, that's all I need to be happy with an erotic novella like this.I liked that there was a surprisingly plentiful cast of secondary characters. The length of the story didn't give much room for them to be fleshed out very well, but spending time with Gage's family and Hailey's friends did add a bit of depth to both main characters. Depth that I enjoyed. I was amused by the relationship between Gage and his brothers and mother. Those weekly breakfast/guilt sessions and the sibling ribbings that went on seemed very natural to the characters and situations. I enjoyed them a lot.I wish that Harte had pushed the envelope of Gage's awkwardness around women even further, because he never really struck me that way when he was around Hailey. He certainly wasn't Mr. Charming, but to have built up the level of neurosis he had over his lack of ability to speak to women without saying something wrong, I would have expected him to be much, much worse than he was. Maybe if he'd been even more blunt, or less endearing with his clumsiness, I would have bought into it a bit more.Hailey didn't do much for me, really. She didn't annoy, but she's too familiar as the uptight, tightly wound Type A personality bordering on prissy. The girl with a killer bod and an ice maiden exterior fashioned from her fear of pain. I wish more originality had gone into her character, but she at least held her own.I'm not a fan of the quick-to-love theme in romance, even in erotic novellas. That, for me, was the bigger issue with the story. I wish the romance had been given a longer lead time, even if it had been in condensed form. I also would have liked a meatier plot, and I'm no fan of relationship conflict that's nothing more than a failure to communicate, as it was here. Those are the things that held me back from completely liking what I read.It was hot, though, I'll say that. And I do have a soft spot for the themes of unrequited love (or lust) and love (lust) from afar, like Gage had for Hailey. He was kind of geeky-cute with his affections and I enjoyed that aspect very much. For a quick read that will definitely raise a gal's body temp, I'd recommend this one, but I personally would have liked more story and a less annoying conflict.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",neutral,book

It was interesting enough to keep me reading for a while. After a little bit, that interest wore off.The bad/ugly: The writing was amatuerish. A lot of telling rather than showing. ""Lana knew xxxxx"" and ""Dover understood xxx, because xxxx"".The thing that got on my nerves the most was the whole ""honor"" situation. That word and the concept displayed in the book hard to have easily taken up 40% of the story. ""You dishonor me by doing this"", ""you honor me so I will do this"" ""Lana questioned such and such's honor"". I mean it literally occurred over and over and over again.The take on the hiding of emotions was interesting. It could have been such a great premise if the story telling was written better (I'm thinking in the vein of Nalini Singh's Psy and the way they are written).All in all I didn't hate this book (otherwise it would have gotten one star).

Strong Main Character/ Female Heroine: Lhung is a bit girly at times, but he comes off as a weird man. I am not sure what to make of him. He is mysterious and I am interested in finding out more about him. He seems like he is fighting some kind of inner demons and I like inner demons. 4 out of 5 stars2. Strong Minor Characters: Taus is intriguing. I want to know more about this mysterious girl with the gorgeous violet eyes. At times, I find her very dark and menacing, but she switches quickly back into a pretty little girl. I do not know if that is the author's intention or not, but I find it very compelling and interesting. I love her vulnerability mixed in with some naivety. She is the perfect foil to Lhung and I hope that he does not mess things up with her and that he pursues her. 5 out of 5 stars3. The Setting: There are a few different places that the author takes you to, but mostly the graphic novel is centered on the characters and how they look. I think if the author would add more of a setting to her book, it would make the novel more interesting to read and discover the world in which her characters live. 3 out of 5 stars4. The Plot: I wish there was more of a plot, besides the little love story in the making, but this is only the first chapter so I can hardly fault the author with that. I just wish there was a little bit more background information about Lhung being a dragon, because this concept is very confusing for me and I am really into the fantasy genre. I like how that mysterious man showed up and I want to know more about him. 3 out of 5 stars5. The Artwork: The characters are beautifully created and the precision just blows my mind. I do not know how the author can create such beautiful drawings and they really are a sight to see. Her drawings are better than a lot of Chinese, Japanese, and Asian graphic novelist. The use of color is very important in this novel, because the author uses color so rarely. So I cannot help but think and notice that the colors are very important to the book and holds special emphasis and hidden meaning. This is not your little brother's comic book. This graphic novel is for mature readers; however at this point, there are not any erotic moments to deem it XXX. 5 out of 5 stars6. The Writing: Okay, I will admit that at times the writing needs a little work, nothing a little proofreading would not cure, but other than that, I found the writing is satisfactory enough for a graphic novel. I do find that the writing lacks style or distinction as a unique work by the author; however, since the author's specialty is in creating beautiful artwork, you cannot expect the writing to be just as good as a novelist. 4 out of 5 stars7. The Dialogue: Sometimes, the dialogue can seem a little forced and slow going. I understand that this is only the first chapter and that the main attraction is the lovely artwork, but I believe that the dialogue needs to hold the reader's attention as well. A little improving an this graphic novel would be excellent and a perfect 5 star. 3 out of 5 starsThe overall rating is 3.86 out of 5 starsReading this graphic novel has inspired me to come up with three new categories to critique.

So if you're in the first chapter and you want to throw it agianst the preverbial wall, keep reading. It does get better.And I LOVED Nikos. I'm not usually much for the alpha male. The whole beat your chest thing is usually a huge turn off for me. But he was SEXY. During the sex scenes, she went a little over the top with the expressions for things, often describing the same feeling over and over again in very flowery, over the top language. Just not my style.But overall, I really loved the played between the hero and heroine, loved the heroine's spunky attitude, and it ended up being a very sweet and spicy romance. Great emotion and great description. I really enjoyed this read. I may even look up more books from this author. I like her style.",neutral,book
5086,"This Very Moment is an easy, relaxed read with strong religious overtones. It is an inspirational story with likeable characters struggling to cope with the difficult realities of grief and lost love. It speaks to the heart about hope, love, and new beginnings.This book was just luke warm, althought it does have a slight crescendo of suspense at the end. It's a story of a sweet love that unfolds into a predictable, but satisfying conclusion. I just wasn't able to stay engaged with the characters and the story, skimming through some of the chapters. My rating is 2.5 stars.",neutral,book
4301,"To avoid spoilers, I'll just say that this is a perfectly okay erotic short story that takes a detour into cheesyness at the end.  The author had an interesting thought process with the masks and the setting, but it was as if she didn't really know what to do after that.",neutral,book
6526,Rating:  4 1/2 starsI was provided a copy of this book from the author for the purpose of an honest review.  I was not compensated for this review - all conclusions are my own responsibility.What makes Kallysten's stories so good is it's not all about the sex.  She develops the story first and the romance between characters is just icing on the cake.  We have vampires and humans fighting against demons.  It's a story you can finish in just a couple of hours and because it's so short you will find it difficult to put down.  The action and suspense are what will hold your attention right up until the end where you'll be left wanting to read more.  And you'll be happy to note that the second and third books titled Blurred Bloodlines and Blurred Memories are also currently available.,neutral,book
11419,"Not alot of violence or cursing.  I enjoyed the book and liked that the crew were tight friends.  No betrayal in part 1 although I feel that a couple of the members of the crew are going to set him up.  Lartesha is a ride or die chick.

11638,"I had great hopes for this book. The premise was different and interesting...a combination that usually spells winner. Unfortunately, not in this case. The pacing drags, there are inconsistent character issues with Brian, (he's known he's different his whole life but describes things and acts in ways that point toward the opposite fact), and then there are the editing issues.

3234,This is a short short story that I assume sets the scene for future stories and it does this really well. You get a good picture of the club and what it's like and who it's for.

The three spend the night together which manages to not just be hot but tender and loving as well. The story ends with their journey together beginning. It was well done. A good read.,neutral,book
10613,"Often when we were young we fell in love with an older sibling's friend. More often than not they did not know we exist let alone realize our feelings about them.  This was the case with Sukie O'Leary, her brother Sean's friend Eamon Houlihan was that teenage crush, and hew was now ranked as one of the best goalies in the National Hockey League. What she didn't know is that Eamon had noticed years ago her growing up and the feelings were mutual.They all still had connections to the old neighborhood that they grew up in, in more ways than one would think.  The boys had been successful in both athletics in high school being able to further on their education by going to Ivy League Schools. Sean was now a successful Trauma Specialist and ER Doctor.  Eamon of course with hockey.  Sukie was being talked about as well now because she had ""cancer"" and that was something everyone whispered about behind her back and looked at her differently.  Which she hated, she wanted people to just treat her like they did before.  While Eamon had wanted to rush back and help when he heard the news earlier, he waited but he did vow to treat her normally.  But he didn't know just what he was getting himself into.Practice makes you perfect is something that we have all heard, well Sukie felt she was out of practice in bed and needed someone to help her, that person was Eamon on the condition no strings attached.  Little did they realize that there were strings and the heat they created with each other was enough to melt the ice rink that Eamon played on. An accident on the ice made them realize how much they did need each other.It was a good short story and did remind us that if you do know someone who has been affected by an illness they do want to be treated normally.  I do hope that the author comes back with a story on Sean because he sounds like an interesting man himself.",neutral,book

5295,"I personally love it when two authors I respect come together on a collaborative work. Blake Crouch and Jack Kilborn come together in the novel Serial.  The novel is a story of hitchhiking at it most terrifying.  Everyone knows that hitchhiking is dangerous, but this novel follows what happens when one truly depraved person picks up another truly depraved human being.  The novel was written in an odd fashion with Kilborn writing the first part and Crouch writing the second with the two of them finishing it over email with 100 - word exchanges without reading what the other person had opened with.  Trust me it makes sense if you ever read it.The Novel Serial is a lot like if Dexter met Dexter but neither one of them had a moral code.  I really enjoyed the novel I just wished it had been longer.  Maybe I'm a little twisted but I would have preferred to at least be rooting for one serial killer over the other.  The characterization is minimal but if you want to have a few disturbing images seared in your mind before bed time this book will deliver.  Hopefully Crouch and Kilborne will attempt a project like this again soon but aim for a full sized novel.  I wish there was more to review but with a story so short and to the point all you need to decide is if you have 2 extra bucks and free hour.",neutral,book
9648,"Previously straight identified college senior Jeremy is conflicted after drunkenly sleeping with his best friend and college roommate Ben. Adding to his discomfort is his growing disinterest in his girlfriend, and the impending changes signaled by his college graduation.Overall I have mixed feelings about this novella. While it had several hot, well written sex scenes and for the most part, able yeoman-like prose advancing the story-line, there were some transitional glitches melding the narrative story-line with the erotic scenes. Admittedly these are two very different forms of storytelling and I felt that they both warranted more development and smoother transitions than the short novella form afforded them.Another shortcoming I perceived was the ""almost adequate"" development of the main characters. We are told a few things about each of the main characters but not really enough to allow us to get fully inside their heads and fully appreciate their feelings. In part, readers read to live vicariously and when the character development is stinted, some of that fulfillment is short-changed. Again, this could have been better if the overall form had not been so rushed.Also on a mixed note, the ability of the author to create charming supporting characters is clearly shown with Al the straight but Texan roommate but the girl friend failed to ring true on almost all levels. There was no detail that allowed me to reconcile what Jeremy had originally seen in her with her nasty racist and sexist hate speech during their break-up scene. It just felt artificial, or worse, poorly written.Finally, the novella starts with a steamy recollection/fantasy but is then jolted back into a straight boy realizing he's not story. I was surprised a bit by my own reaction to having to re-imagine the boyfriend after it was reveal that he was black. While it certainly didn't affect his sexiness, it wasn't made clear in the initial description and my fantasy lover's tend to be white. For a while I found myself contemplating what my level of racism was rather than concentrating on the details of the story. However this morphed into my speculation about how much more I could have appreciated the story if I'd been given some of the build-up before the major sex scene.As with so many stories that give details like this, It's a bit tricky deciding just how much detail to reveal. It's a bit like being given a perfectly brewed cup of coffee with two sugars and milk. No matter how great the coffee and perfect the brew if one takes ones coffee unsweetened and black, it's a bit hard to appreciate the overall beverage.Overall, I've decided that I enjoyed it but will be curious to read something longer by the author to see if the imperfections I found here are cured when she has more room to work. Read it and judge for yourself.",neutral,book

7909,I read the other 2 reviews only after reading the story itself. I wanted to see why it was rated so low. It's not just another erotic short designed to satisfy a kink craving. I would say it belongs more in an erotic horror category. I was really surprised by the plot twist but in a good way. This free read actually intrigued me enough to purchase the full series which I enjoyed just as much. I guess it just depends on what you are into. I think this book was rated low due to being placed in a catch-all category that doesn't fully describe the content of the book. maybe a disclaimer placed in the product description could clear up and confusion.,neutral,book

11506,"There is a good concept lurking in the middle of this uneventful piece, but I think the writer couldn't decide whether it was fantasy or a story with morals. Not that one or the other can't coexist. The stage was set with two strong characters of Faldon and Selina, with Faldon bearing a curse, which makes him untrustworthy to his own people. The thing I found most confusing was how they travelled to and from hither and fro, to the extent that I didn't know whether they were coming or going. The end was unexpected that I will grant you, but it deflated the story a little, because it had taken so much time to get there.",neutral,book
703,"I picked this book up for free quite some time ago, and finally had the time and the urge to read it. It's professional in presentation, and I found few errors, so I was impressed with that. I'm not thrilled with the cover art, but that is more a matter of taste than any failing on quality. This book would look good next to a big six book on the shelf. It's worth paying for, and I'm shocked to see that it is still available for free. So is the sequel. Wow.First of all, be prepared for a long read. Granted this isn't a 1,000 page monstrosity like some fantasy books that come out, but it is well over 600 pages, so it's a healthy read. Personally, I would have broken it into two books. At 52% a major plot line resolves, and while the overall &#34;evil&#34; is still around, the book could have easily finished up at this point, and the rest of the overarching plot could have been resolved in a second book.There's quite a lot of decent action, and the bad guys are suitably bad. I think the good guys could have been a bit more competent, or at least have more than one or two people who could actually do anything. I realize we want the heroes to appear properly heroic, but I felt at time that the population was so lacking that they almost deserved to get slaughtered. The trials that the main hero and heroine undergo are impressively trying though, so that was nice.I'd actually call this a 3.5 star rating. It's good enough that I will be reading the sequel, but as it is also over 600 pages, it will have to wait until I'm up for something that long.",neutral,book

5897,"There is nothing original in this very short Regency M/M romance.The setting is the usual one, gay aristocrats having to cope with the homophobic, claustrophobic mores of a time and society when laws founded on religious beliefs used to fetter people's life.To this well trodden setting the author adds the usual topic of forced proximity as the two lovers are bound to remain in the same place for a given numer of days and have no way to avoid each other, again a very common choice in this kind of novels.There is one twist though: the two star-crossed lovers have not only already met (this would be common) but they have been lovers in their early youth, until they were separated when one of them, a second son and therefore kind of useless to his father, was sent to war to acquire a status for himself. Problem is that, after five years, he had to come back because (second twist) he has lost his left forearm. Haunted by honour, duty and guilt Ian (the come-back soldier) has to be seduced again because he seems to consider the previous affair with Nicky a juvenile mistake and the attraction he still feels for Nicky something to be repressed.I will not spoil the third twist (a bit contrived) that allows them their happily ever after.All in all the story was captivating. The two main characters are easy to love even if the soldier sounds more childish, at times, than guilt-ridden and the other lover seems a little too unsouciant.The story could surely have born more fleshing out: it takes place within a limited time scope (twelve days) but it needs not have taken twelve pages to be told. There are several moments that feel hurried and character building could have been better.More care should have also been given to the sex scenes: they are emotional because of the baggage the two carry with them but they are not very erotic.",neutral,book

769,"This one was better than First Contact. It concentrated more on story than on just fighting. I have a gripe about Tesh-Dar. In this prequel series, we keep getting ""told"" how mighty Tesh-Dar is. I got tired of the repetition quickly. Fine, the author wants to change his mythos in these prequels. I guess that is his prerogative, but it just feels wrong if the reader still remembers the other three books. It undoes the logic and therefore the suspension of disbelief. Tesh-Dar can walk through walls, send herself through space, but can't get out from under a cave-in???? Even taking into account that she was 100 years older, in the first three books, it just doesn't feel like it makes sense anymore.

This guy doesn't get the concept of ""Actions speak louder than words,"" or that maybe if your mate and all of your loyal friends tell you you're making a few mistakes you should listen to them. But nope, not our hero. He just doesn't comprehend why everyone doesn't just accept how absolutely right he is about everything. For someone chosen to be a member of an elite shifter version of Special Forces, this lack of judgment seems like a major liability.I did enjoy rolling my eyes at this guy's stupidity, as well as the appearances of the characters from previous books. On the down side, his ""little friend"" in this book (who pretty much derails his relationship,) also figures into the new series, Halle Shifters. I cringe to think that she will be an important character there, as she is selfish, immature and not at all likable. Unfortunately, she was given a ""special connection"" to a really great secondary character. What's with her and these ""special connections"" to the male characters? Maybe we'll get lucky and she'll mature some. Otherwise, I doubt the new series will be as enjoyable as the previous books.

2759,"2.5 stars.I have a somewhat two-minded opinion about Force of Law.On one hand, it was a nice, light and entertaining enough read. A fun parody--even though trying too hard at times. Nothing heavy. Nothing that requires much attention/concentration. Nothing breath-taking and outstanding that will be remembered forever, but entertaining, nonetheless.On the other hand, it just was too much, at times--even though the book is intentionally cliched and over the top:Law is this alpha male of all alpha males. He's super talented, smart, intelligent, successful, powerful, dominant, rich, handsome, fearleass, brave, honourable, strong-minded. He's a billionaire. He's got the world laid out to his feet. Everyting he does or touches turns into gold. He might be a god..., he certainly feels and behaves like one. He's awfully arrogant or sure of himself--however you'd like to interpret it. When planning a picnic, he's using his helicopter or jet to get there, flying the thing himself, naturally. When confronted with a gun (while being unarmed himself) he fearlessly and single-handedly, and, of course, successfully--was there ever any doubt?--wrestles the gun-holding ""opponent"" for the gun, knocking him out easily while he's at it. And that's that. He joined the force and went to Afghanistan for no other reason than to kill Osama Bin Laden himself. While fighting bravely at the front for freedom and against terrorism, he's running his corporation via satellite (his private one, of course) and quite successfully so.In contrast to Law Tom--although being refered to as tough (why?)--can only be compared to a damsel in distress, helplessly waiting for the shining knight in armor to save the day or, which would be more appriopriate in Law's case, to save the world. I don't really like this kind of dynamic in a relationship, neither straight nor gay.And the rape-but-not-rape scene wasn't anything I liked very much, either. Tom was scared to death, waiting for the inevitable while trying to convince himself that it won't be all that bad, that it will be OK, and he just realizes that he's actually turned on as hell the second he feels Law's *** (or, to put it nice: member) up his virgin ***. That was too close for comfort. (A D/s [BDSM] dynamic is fine, even hot, but here it isn't. The thing between Law and Tom is not a D/s thing, not in that way.) I couldn't find anything remotely romantic in that.Yes, this book wants to be a parody, wants to be over the top.

8431,This is a sweet read about true love.  Everyone always has a day that they want to do over. This couple gets so much more than just a do over. AJ and Cooper will continue to try until they get it right whether they want to or not. The Gods don&#8217;t give second chances so easily and when they do they make you work for it. Is their love strong enough to break the cycle or are they going to chase their dreams forever?I enjoyed Cooper and AJ&#8217;s story. The two truly love one another and make a great couple. As they work through their past mistakes the love that they have for each other shines through and they only need to grab it.  As we watch the two repeat their day we see so much happen with just a split second decision in your day so much can change. It was interesting to see how their day would unfold with each new decision and with each change their bond only grows stronger.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.,neutral,book

10941,"** Note: this story appears as a bonus in the paperback edition of Survivor's Quest. **Fool's Bargain is a short story featuring the stormtroopers of Aurek-Four, a unit of the Imperial 501st Legion of the Empire of the Hand.  It takes place shortly before the events of Survivor's Quest, but is probably best read after.The Empire of the Hand is involved in a war to rid the native Eickarie people of their latest warlord, but the 501st curious orders are very specific - take the warlord alive.  This story is tightly focused, with a couple of characters firmly at the center.  There's good detail here but for some reason it doesn't feel as well developed as other short stories I've read by Zahn.  Also,  those who look for big names in their Star Wars stories will want to give this a pass.  A couple of minor characters from Survivor's Quest show up in largely supporting roles, but there are no movie characters nor beloved favorites here.But despite these caveats Fool's Bargain is a good short story that gives further glimpse of Zahn's take on stormtroopers, which he touched on in Survivor's Quest, and would continue to explore in later novels (Allegiance and Choices of One).",neutral,book
8226,"The first book in the Blurred Trilogy and part of The Demon Age series is set in the future after a demon apocalypse and is full of suspense, action, vampires, demons and romance.I found myself intrigued with this book right from the beginning.  It starts off with a battle and the action continues throughout.  The author has created a post apocalyptic fantasy world with a unique twist and very engaging characters.The heroes, Marc and Blake, and the heroine, Kate, find themselves fighting on the same side against the demons set on destroying the world.  The emotional drama the characters find themselves in draws the reader into the story as Marc and Blake join Kate's military group to try to close the demon rip, and find themselves attracted to Kate. They each try to get her attention as they deal with their own personal issues with each other. Kate is equally attracted to them both, but doesn't know what to think or do about that, besides she is on a mission and doesn't need the complication.The reader's attention is also captured by the depth the supporting characters add to this drama filled story.  The well written battle scenes come to life in this intriguing tale and you can feel the chemistry building between the three main characters.  The sex in the story is very hot and leaves the reader wanting more.The author leaves us with not only a war cliff hanger, but a romantic cliff hanger as well, but she left us a great spot in the story.  This was a fantastic story and I will be reading more of the books in this series.",neutral,book
2653,"There is a lot of jumping around - which I don't mind if it ends up pulled together.  Much did not.  This was more stream of consciousness writing and did not flow real well or in cogent manner plot wise.  Perhaps some of that is genre related (I can admit - noir is not my normal bag) .There are a lot of editing issues (missed words /punctuation) .  The randomness without back story of the characters lets much hang.  Description without fleshing out of characters was also disappointing.  Although (I have said this before) some may be related to length and it being prohibitive to such.  I just find it frustrating when there is real meat to a story, but it just ends without going through the paces set forth initially.  There is so much potential for this were it run through its paces as a full novel (or even novella) .  This felt (as I read) unique voicewise and plotwise.  It just never delivered - even becoming predictible in some parts.  There were just too many plot devices started and /or hinted at without development.I would have rated one star for reasons stated above - the save was the wry voice of the writer - which garnered two stars alone.Not recommended if you are a reader for whom pacing and story completion (other than with just ""there done because I end it here "") are important.  Recommended if you are looking for something different to read from a writer with a good voice.  I would try another from this author provided it is a bit longer to ensure (hopefully) full story development.  The writer has the goods - just needs to show the stamina.Cbristine",neutral,book
6394,"Jace Rankin may be short, but he's nothing to mess with, as the man who was just hauled out of the saloon by the undertaker knows now. He's a famous bounty hunter in Oregon in the 1890s who, when he shot the man in the saloon, just finished a years long quest to avenge his sister's murder and is now trying to figure out what to do next. When the snotty-nosed farm boy he just rescued from a gang of bullies offers him money to kill a man who forced him off his ranch, he reluctantly agrees to bring the man to justice, but not to kill him outright. But, first he needs to tell his sister's widower the news.Kyla ""Kyle"" Springer Bailey has been riding the trails and sleeping on the ground for the past month while trying to find Jace. She wants revenge on the man who killed her husband and took her ranch, amongst other crimes, and she's not so keen on the detour Jace wants to take. But she realizes she's out of options, so she hides behind her boy persona as best she can and tries to keep pace. When a confrontation along the way gets her shot and Jace discovers that Kyle's a Kyla, she has to come clean about the *whole* reason she needs this scoundrel dead and hope he'll still help her.The book has its share of touching moments and slow-blooming romance. Kyla, we find out, has good reason to fear men and hide behind a boy's persona. Watching Jace slowly pull her out of that shell and help her conquer her fears was endearing. Her pain was real and deeply-rooted and didn't just disappear in the face of his sexiness. Neither did his understandable aversion to marriage magically disappear after a round of nookie. Why would a man who's drifted from town to town for his entire adult life - a man who's killed his fair share of men along the way - feel he'd make a good husband or father? They're both the walking wounded and in a unique position to help each other, they just need time to realize it.However, while it was packed to bursting with my favorite themes - Old West setting, a heroine passing as male, a morally ambiguous hero, wounded souls, road romance, the kitchen sink - there was a certain...distance in the writing that kept me from getting carried away. Both characters were distinct and fully-formed and I couldn't point to any glaring instances of bland telling or anything, I just never felt really invested. I enjoyed it quite a bit, as it was an exciting trip, but I was watching them from far away. I definitely wasn't on the run alongside them. Add on a hasty and too tidy ending, and the book left me feeling a bit less than completely satisfied.I enjoyed the book, but I can't say it was above average. I'd still read another book by the author.Note: I read the re-released ebook version and noticed there were a lot of formatting errors and missing words.

6079,"Below you will see my review for the old Kindle app which I rated one star.  I am now upping it to three stars.  I canceled the paper with the old app because it was too incomplete.  This version has more of what is in the paper.  Sadly you can no longer buy a single addition proving yet again that the Times does not have much respect for the consumer, but I will subscribe to this when I am away from the paper version and cancel when I am in an area with access to the real paper.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I have had the Kindle version of the paper for a year or so and have enjoyed having it on the road.  However, it is an extremely abridged version of the paper.  So if you need some information like theater schedules, you need to use the online version.  The Kindle version is particularly bad since it has very little of the actual paper information.  It also is far inferior to the online version.  I finally had to give it up since it really is inadequate and woefully overpriced at nearly double other papers.  I suggest getting the free BBC app and USA today free version (not that I particularly like USA today).  But the combination of these two free services is far superior to the NYT Kindle version.  Or subscribe to just the NYT online version which has a full news experience though it is very cluttered compared to some of the cleaner more modern news apps.",neutral,book

Now, hope comes in the form of a Drui female mated to Xanthus, his heir.Shy and introverted Jazzlyn McCabe has gathered the courage to beg a favor from a lady she barely knows.  The owner of Inner Magick is Aislinn and she offered Jazzlyn help should she need it when they met at a gem mart months ago.Kirill has come to the world dominated by humans to find his mate who he glimpsed ages past in a mirror.  Jazzlyn asks Aislinn to help locate her missing cousin Caro, but what Jazzlyn gets is the man she saw in a mirror at Inner Magick.  It is time for Kirill to introduce Jazzlyn to true magic and her mate, him.Dragon Mate is the latest sensual treat in the Supernatural Bonds series by talented author Jory Strong.  This is a stand alone story but fans of the series will remember characters from earlier tales.  Dragon Mate is entertaining and sexy although Jazzlyn's responses don't always seem real.  For someone with no previous knowledge of magic she seems too easily accepting, taking it all in stride with barely a squawk or real appreciation. I've loved this series since the beginning and while Dragon Mate is definitely enjoyable there is just something that doesn't ring true with the heroine's reactions to the unimaginable.LisaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",neutral,book

The writing just meandered along with aimless direction, and when I would put the book down and come back to it later I often forgot who was involved/connected to whom.

8096,"MadnessLet me start off by getting the bad news out of the way, telling you what issues I had with Madness, by Sorcha MacMurrough:Sweet Lord, the spelling errors!  I am more than willing to forgive an error or two in a good book.  It can even be fun to spot them, it makes you feel clever and perceptive.  Not so in Madness, there were so many, many errors that it became more of a challenge to try to ignore them!  I was seriously disappointed by this because it knocked what could have been a great book down to just a good book, if your willing to overlook the mistakes.Editors, help!  There were a few charactors whom could have done with more development, less repetition.  Along the same lines, I felt like the book could have lost a few chapters, sped things along and been made better for it.  Also, I have to say that I wish addiction and mental illness could be addressed in reality as simply as it is in this book.  Not that this aspect was handled badly, just that it contradicts conventional understanding of both topics.  Its simplified, I guess I would say.  My final complaint is the ending... without giving anything away, I will say that there are some remarkable coincidences and unimaginable good luck.  Something more practical may have been better.Now, all of that being said, I did enjoy this book.  I can honestly say that this book is very different from other romance novels I've read.  For one thing, the main female character, Gabrielle, is the hero of the story.  She literally and figuratively rescues her man, Simon.  Gabrielle is a strong, determined, hard working woman who knows her own mind.  She is not afraid to do what she has to in order to protect the people she loves.  She isn't afraid to go against conventional society norms and make choices and decisions that are right for her, what will make her happy.  Gabrielle was resourceful and stubborn in an endearing way.  She was the kind of character that you wanted to see happy at the end of the story.As for the Hero of the book, Simon... What can I say?  Simon is the kind of man every girl wants to find and keep forever.  Simon is smart, strong, handsome, loyal but with horrors in his past and demons that only his Lady Love can help him overcome.  Simon was passionate, sweet, thoughtful, brave and absolutely devoted to his Lady.  He has an insatiable love and lust for Gabrielle and he is determined to fight to transform himself into the kind of man who is worthy of her love.  One thing that I really appreciated about this story is the fact that Simon's intelligence was celebrated instead of down played or perceived as a weakness.  He's a hot hunk of man, but with a brain and a huge heart.While the physical relationship between Gabrielle and Simon doesn't begin immediately, once it begins... its on!  There was A LOT of sex in this story.  Tastefully done but abundant. The plus side to this, perhaps, is that the love that Gabrielle and Simon feel for one another is obvious and sweet, which for me made the banquet of sex less pointless or tedious.I would recommend this book to friends, with the aforementioned caution on the spelling and grammar errors.  If the small issues I mentioned were fixed, I would have given this book 5 stars.  The characters and the love they shared was solid gold, the story was interesting and manages to draw you into the dark corners that these characters visit, then usher you back to the light with the love they discover with one another.  Madness was worth the read, good enough that I'm not going to include a pun based on the title in my review.",neutral,book

The technology the author introduces stretches credulity a bit, but I can live with that just fine; the book is fiction trending toward science fiction after all.All of the good ideas are wiped away by one key failing as far as I can tell: no editor. Or, if an editor was used that person was, well, not very good. A good editor could have easily cut 20,000 or more words out of the book and it would have been much better for it. An editor would, I hope, have caught a mistake like this from a scene where characters in 1912 are discussing armaments available to them on the Titanic:""I want one of those!"" probably have had some Lee Enfield MKIII Short Rifles on board for close confines of ship. It was in .303 British caliber a pretty potent round up to 300 yards. You can probably google those weapons if you need more particulars.""If I thought it would do any good other than getting more men killed than these disgusting creatures"", Murdoch replied, ""I'd break into the Vickers machine guns on board.""The author's note to himself to do a little more research on SMLE rifles finds its way into the final text.There are many other examples similar to this one throughout the book. Not author notes appearing, but problems that never would have been had a good editor been used.The author came up with what I think was a very good idea for a story with a different take on the Titanic disaster and it could have been epic.

10706,"I really enjoyed other books from this author, but found this one a bit disappointing. The concept was really interesting, and wish it was explored more fully, as it has enormous potential. What would happen if 99.99% of people on the planet disappeared overnight? No struggle or violence, just gone? But the idea was diluted by unexplained appearance of mythical creatures, changed rules of physics, and the unplausible explanation of the survivors all having psychic abilities. I was also a little irritated by the romantic relationship in the book, there was too much starting and glaring and too little normal communication and straight forward talking.",neutral,book

4081,"I love Josh Lanyon and so it was a happy early Christmas present to find this as a kindle freebee. A freebee from a known, reputable writer is always a thing of joy. So 4 stars for that. It lost half a star because it was actually not my favorite of his works, and it wasn't as believable as his previous works. I didn't fall in love with either of the two protagonists - James the disgraced antiquarian or Sedgewick,  the unlikely book owner.  Nor did I find the reason for Sedgewick's hatred for the evil potential book buyer sufficiently compelling. So weaker on both plot and characterization, but a weak Lanyon is still a strong book, and certainly worth a read (or reread)",neutral,book

Even worse, her abuser has tracked her to her new residence.  With the help of a new friend, a few elves, and newfound talents, she overcomes frightening odds and triumphs over evil.I like the way Ms Hinsley fills in the background for her story - some things are merely hinted, giving it a more ominous, foreboding feeling, although I wished certain parts were explained a little further, and the main characters fleshed out more thoroughly.Overall, the book was well-written and edited, with a fresh storyline that keeps the reader interested.

I liked the story, but the one thing I have found by reading a few titles from these authors is that they seem to be more interested in being shocking and controversial, than they are in making a full-bodied story. You could sort of feel the shift in excitement when they had the opportunity to write something really vile.I am a fan of horror and gore, but not just for its own sake. Seemed like they wanted to write some sick, twisted scenes and needed to put a book around them to make them ""respectable"". Not a bad read, but not great. Just pretty good.",neutral,book

2179,"I had a little trouble getting into this book. I usually prefer historical romance to futuristic stories, but I was kind of drawn in by the concept of genetic engineering of classes of people. In this world, there are normal women called fems, normal men called mems, submissive females called obedients and super warrior males called primales. The primale Theron is called upon by the High Council to guard the fem Nyssa from threats of death. Against both of their wills they are drawn to each other, but primales never mate with fems, only obedients. The only way Theron can keep Nyssa under his watch is by physically dominating her. She says she hates it, but secretly she loves it.There is a lot of very graphic sex and BDSM scenes in this book, more so than plot. I think that if all the sex scenes were gone, the book would be half as long as it is now. What there is of a plot isn't bad, and the writer tries to show the difference in thinking between men (more than men) and women in dealing with conflict.Heat factor hot.",neutral,book

And I liked how when Ethan cames back three years later he's the one who is vulnerable & Will is the strong one.

8354,"The Great Gray Lady is one way some people refer to the ""New York Times"" to describe the expanse of type compared to the newspaper space devoted to images.That's what I thought of when I first subscribed to and started reading ""The New Yorker,"" Kindle edition. Holy Cow, there's still a lot of good stuff to read but certainly a lot less to look at.Gone are the provocative photographs. Also missing, the lush advertisements for everything from Kohler bathroom fixtures, to a two-page display inviting me to fly Air France.  I'm one who first pulls out and throws the Sunday newspaper inserts into the recycling bin. I never would have thought I'd miss the magazine advertising but I do. At least the New Yorker cartoons remain on the Kindle edition although they are a little washed out but I'm willing to live with that.The e-New Yorker navigation has improved from when I first subscribed. The screen is now divided vertically. Left half contains the section headings, ""The Talk of the Town,"" Reporting & Essays"" ""The Critics."" Toggle over to the right and the articles are highlighted for that section. That makes cruising through the magazine easy enough to make for a pleasant read.I've subscribed to the print edition for more than 20 years and still anticipate Thursdays when it's delivered to my address. I still make it my week's work to read most of the content. These days, though, most of the time I find I'm reading most of the magazine on the Kindle. I use my Kindle to aggregate all my reading material in one place and I like that.Overall, the ""The New Yorker"" Kindle edition presents me with a couple of things I'd describe as a little distracting, just a tick shy of annoying. But those distractions, for me, are more than compensated for by the portability the Kindle offers - and the fact that I can easily archive all the issues.At the end of the day the ""The New Yorker"" is really all about the content, isn't it. And the availability of the magazine loaded onto my device in a readable format every Monday morning by the time I get up makes me one satisfied Kindle subscriber.",neutral,book

Not to mention the whole paranormal aspect came out of left field for me, this could have been of course because I zoned out, but still it didn't fit for me. The writing was weak and the character development and story was pretty much non-existent, I get this is a short story but a decent writer can still create a complete story that flows in a limited amount of pages, and this author wrote a longer story than most naught nooners!

9374,"Plot/Storyline: 3 3/4 StarsWith an extremely original plot, the reader is taken on a trip with many twists and turns. This is not your typical terrorist or serial killer book. Instead, it is a combination of both.Told mainly from the viewpoints of Major Lane, FBI Agent Catherine, and the `bomb planter,' the reader gets a panoramic view of the events. There are several other portions told from the viewpoints of some of the victims with some background thrown in for empathy with even the smallest of character parts.The only downfall was all of the extraneous scenes. I had to wade through an entire chapter of Catherine going home and getting into her hot tub, alone. I had to sift through another chapter of Lane visiting a mall; I tried to find some relevance, but failed. There was even an entire thread that followed a college student, who was only on the peripheral of the investigation.A good thirty percent of this novel should have been left in the ""Recycling Bin"" on the author's computer. Yes, it would have been much shorter, but the result would be a tightly written thriller.I understood the motive of the bad guy. However, I do feel it would have been made more clear if a certain event in his daughter's life had happened elsewhere. If this sounds cryptic, then I have done my job of not including spoilers.It was very obvious that some detailed research went into the writing of this novel. That made for some interesting, and even somewhat educational reading. Yes, I accidentally learned some things.Character Development: 4 1/4 StarsMajor Lane was a strong character. To depict him with a drug addiction was terrific, but to have it also entertwine so well with the plot was a stroke of genius. I would love to see a new thriller with Lane as an ongoing character.Catherine was also a well-developed character. She was a terrific foil for Lane, providing for not only an interesting love interest, but also how difficult being a female FBI agent must be.Although much of the book was told from the bad guy's viewpoint, his character development was still weak. As I mentioned above, a change in location of an event in his daughter's life would definitely have made his motive more believable, and even could have evoked more sympathy with the reader. As it stood, I just couldn't empathize with him.Writing Style: 4 3/4 StarsThe writing style only suffered on one point. For some reason, in several places, the author chose to use words in all caps for emphasis. I would be reading along, when all of the sudden, there would be a BIG BOOM. This was just distracting to the reading process.Otherwise, the writing was outstanding. The descriptions, though verbose at times, were vivid. The dialogue was realistic with good voice. The sentence structuring was complex, yet easy to read.Editing/Formatting: 5 StarsBoth were of professional quality.Rating: PG-13 for Violence and Drug Use",neutral,book

I bought it looking for something simple and cute, and that's exactly what I got.The characters were well-formed and managed to develop as the story progressed--as did their relationship, which did a fairly good job of transitioning from random hook-up to Something Deeper.The plot was fairly well-done, and, although it remained on the simple side of things, it had no gaping plot-holes. There were a few things that could have been developed better or that simply didn't add much to the story, but they also didn't detract anything from it. Also, while the antagonist turned out to be fairly cliche and one-dimensional, it wasn't too obvious who he was (or I was over-thinking things and giving the author too much credit...), which is pretty impressive for the simplicity of the novel.Smut was present and well-written, but didn't hijack the story as so often happens.All in all it was a pretty good read, I'm glad that I read it, and I'd recommend it as light reading.",neutral,book

5893,"I finished The Stranger almost 3 months ago but couldn't put my thoughts on it into words for a review.After reading the first few chapter I was unsure on whether I'd read or not. I didn't like the idea of the hero deceiving the heroine but he grew on me and so did this story.5 years ago, Caleb and his half brothers pass the Shafton farm house and ask for a meal. Laura Shafton's naive husband welcomes the strangers with open arms and soon the unthinkable happens when one the brothers attempts to rape the pregnant Laura her. Caleb tries to stop his brother but Laura's trauma over the attempted attack and the murder of her husband has her implementing all of the brothers in the crimes including Caleb. The 3 brothers leave and Laura is left scarred, traumatized and a widow with a baby on the way.Fast forward 5 years later. After being released from prison (being the caught scapegoat while his brothers get away), Caleb still remembers the pretty Laura Shafton and what happened at that ranch. He passes by wondering if she's okay and what happened to her. When he gets there he finds Laura and her 4 year old son and seeing her scarred face and haunted eyes brings back the memories. To absolve himself for even being there, he offers to help her around her ranch. She cautiously takes the stranger's offer and soon finds herself befriending the mysterious and rugged Caleb while her son falls in love with having a male figure around.I was really surprised to find myself actually liking this story. Laura is such a strong heroine. You'll cry for all she's lost in family, raising her son alone and losing her confidence in showing her face in town embarrassed by her scarred face. How she survived her ordeal and kept on moving makes her a heroine to love. Caleb is a hero you sympathize with. As a half breed (American/Native American), you feel for him wanting to be around his brothers and accepted but realizing how evil they are and trying to fully break free from their holds even when they're not around.I enjoyed Caleb and Laura separated and definitely together and her son is adorable and his relationship with Caleb and Caleb's ""fatherly"" patience with him made me like Caleb even more.Overall: I'd definitely pick this one up if I were you.

When he finds his long-ago high school classmates are being murdered, he and his friends step in to try to find the killer and protect Penny, his new-found love. I have read many books with female civilians getting caught up in a murder mystery, but this time it is a man who noses his way into the action. The cops don't like it - until he comes up with some interesting clues. I enjoyed the variety and personality differences in the characters. It is also fun to read about people closer to my age.It is a reminder to younger people that love can bloom at any age, but I thought the romantic antics started to get in the way of the mystery.

9961,"For the record: I like spanking romances.  I'm not one of those people who reads one and doesn't know what she's getting into.This historic novel is what is called magical realism.  It is set in the real world but has magical elements.  I like magical realism.I went back and forth on liking this one.  I feel like a lot of these novels are really anti-women's rights.  I do not think that historic novels or DD (domestic discipline) romances have to disregard women as intelligent creatures so much.  I do not think that BDSM, DD and all of that has to disregard feminism.  In fact, in real life it rarely does and if it does it should be avoided.The fact that the main character is a strong woman who was born in the wrong time is fine.  It makes sense that she would be beaten every time she expressed an opinion.  It was awesome that she was so strong and capable but still feminine.  I liked that she was able to earn some respect.The things that bothered me about this book were these:-The men in it were unrealistic pigs.  They did not act like gentlemen would have acted at the time.  A man of that time would have acted like a gentleman in public and the fact that he was chastising a woman would not have been publicized like it is in this novel.-Her brothers were abusive monsters.-The men acted like the main character was some horrible brat when all they needed to do was reason with her.  Seriously, a polite explanation as to why she shouldn't do something would have gone a long way.  In fact, some politeness somewhere, anywhere in the book would have been appreciated.-When she proved herself they still refused to allow her some leeway.-All the men were bullies except one and he didn't get the girl.-The characters were all fairly unlikable.  If I'm going to read a cheap romance novel I want to like the characters.  The point of cheap romance novels is wish fulfillment.  Literary fiction is for disappointment.-The men in this story at some point just decided that they would be unreasonable for no reason.  The author was using those instances to get to the next spanking scene.  However, it made it really hard to like the male characters.-The main character was smart but acted like a moron.  At some point she needed to figure out how to act and how to get her way.-At one point the main male character lied to the heroine and tricked her.  Then acted like he was in the right.-The thing that bothered me the most was that at the end the heroine tried to implement a change that would have advanced women's rights.  She was beaten by her husband until she promised to recant that move.  Of all people her husband should have supported her.  What she was asking for was not unreasonable and the king was willing to grant it.Anyway, if all you read these for is the sex and the spanking scenes you will enjoy it.  If you actually want to read a decent story look elsewhere.",neutral,book
10329,"4.5 starsI read this story as part of the Angels' Flight anthology which contains 4 Guild Hunter novellas.If you have read any of the other books you'll probably remember talk of guild hunter Ashwini and her vampire nemesis. Janvier has a very bad habit of getting himself in trouble with the angels and doing a disappearing act which means the guild are called in to track him down. Ash has spent years chasing him across the world and through the bayou only for him to always make his peace with the angel who hired her just before she catches him. For once Ash's job isn't to search for Janvier though and this time she actually needs his help, she has been asked to find a kidnapped vampire but the last thing she wants is to be caught up in the politics between two of the vampires who report to the angel Nazarach. Since Janvier is familiar with all of the vampires involved she is hoping he can smooth the way and help her through the situation in one piece.Angel's Pawn is the shortest of the novellas included in this book and it is also the only one where we don't get to see a full on relationship develop between the two main characters. In spite of that it was a really enjoyable read and I absolutely loved the banter between Ash and Janvier. they have great chemistry and I have high hopes for them hooking up at some point as the series progresses - there is no way they can deny their connection forever! Ash has always been on the sidelines (although she does have a larger role in the 4th book Archangel's Blade) so we don't know a huge amount about her but she has some very interesting abilities that I'm looking forward to learning more about in future books. I don't remember actually being introduced to Janvier in the earlier books, he was mentioned but I don't think we ever saw him, so it was great to get a taste of his character too. He is one sexy Cajun with a real playboy attitude but he seems to have met his match in Ash and it looks like he's more than willing to explore their attraction.",neutral,book

351,"It's Jodi's birthday, and she's stuck at work observing a potential client's house. Worse yet, it's her so-called-boyfriend who put her there. He insisted she'd handle this particular case of breaking and entering to prove to the owner that they were the better security company. All goes well until Jodi gets caught and cuffed between two men.That's the smattering of plot, and pretty much the extent of my enjoyment of the novella. It had its moments but deflated pretty quickly. There wasn't really any foreplay-you know, the part that's supposed to turn people on-and only the setting itself was intriguing.Had the author chosen an honest roleplay option I would have enjoyed the erotica part more, but Braemel chose to underline Jodi's insecurities and all the things that made her an unlikeable character to me. The author also chose to wrote lengthy explanations on why would a normal, usually a quite vanilla, woman acquiesce to participate in a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois with her boyfriend and a man she'd never met before. I'm assuming this was done to lure in the threesome newbie readers, and I'm assuming the pandering in the end was written for them too.For me, it didn't work. The sex got boring after the first nipple sucking and the attempt to add plot and justification for a couple taking a one night lover pretty much ruined any and all respect I had left for the characters. Any of them. It's safe to say that without heavy-handed recommendations from my friends, I won't be reading more of Leah Braemel's work.",neutral,book

7871,"The Order of the Four Sons, or O4S as the modern organization call itself, is under attack. Teams are disappearing on missions, yet events that demand their attention are on the rise in frequency and intensity. After sending out every spare group of people, even the main office's administrative staff, they bring in a misfit crew to investigate a mysterious phone call received just that day from an agent who disappeared 20 years ago from a small town called Excelsior Springs.Set in the modern day, this story is not focused on Egyptian mythology, despite the description and the intro chapter. I found this to be action-packed and interesting. The banter between the teammates is natural and often humorous. The setting in Excelsior Springs, including the history involved, is also impressive. I was surprised and pleased with the historical fiction aspects of the story, many of which involved this little town. It was clever to link a famous historical figure with O4S, though I don't want to say who the figure is due to spoilers. The old hotel and the alternate old hotel are both extremely creepy, especially due to the creatures and ghosts that inhabit them.Murphy, Bill and Kate are my favorites from the team. Murphy, the detective, is a sceptic; even after he finds himself transported to another dimension, he still refuses to believe, though he deals with what he's experiencing. Bill monitors, records and coordinates the efforts of the team as they investigate. He pops in with humorous remarks and seems to be their tether to the real world. Finally, Kate, the apprentice mage who thought she was simply coming for her first training mission, instead finds herself on a desperate mission, facing terrifying enemies.And those terrifying enemies are numerous and varied. Counted among them are ghosts, demons, immortal serial killers, and the particularly nasty spirit that spawned The Order of the Four Sons in the first place.Overall, I really enjoyed this story, particularly the historical fiction and the ongoing battle between good and evil. This is the first in a series, so the book ends off with a set up for the next one. I'd recommend this book for those who like books with interesting characters, historical tie ins, and cameos by famous (and infamous) historical figures. Others may enjoy the paranormal spin on a story set in the modern world.",neutral,book

10445,"3.5 StarsThis is one hot and steamy paranormal romance! It has vampires and erotic romance rolled into one-my favorite! It's the first book to the Midnight Playground series and a good start at that. I think this book may be a long novella since I was able to read it in a few short hours. I had no idea it had menages in it. Maybe I should have looked at the cover first. Nice little surprise there. :)Hex and Aleron have been together for ages, until Nissa walks in and captures the attention of both men. They all spend time together enjoying each others company...and boy oh boy was it hot! Eden sure knows how to write a sex scene! But in the end, only one man is left standing with Nissa. I did feel sorry for the one male left on his own. It wasn't a sad ending where they parted on bad terms...they clearly want each other to be happy...but I just want him to get his happy ending and hopefully he will. The Seeking Kiss was a quick and fast read that will keep your blood pumping until the very end.This is my first read by this author.

She notices a really hot guy who causes her to have very exciting fantasies. When she realizes that he and another hot guy are coming her way, she looks around to see who they are coming over to see because it cannot be her!Former geeks in high school, Mason and Hunter are at the party just to see if the Claire they are hearing about from Mason's associate Paul, is the same Claire they went to high school with and she is! She hasn't changed at all, still watching life happen around her because she is so shy. They have been looking for her for the past 10 years, they had a crush on her and they want to see if it still exists and lucky for Claire, it does.Since Claire has been making New Years resolutions she figures she might as well go through with them so, she agrees to join Mason and Hunter for an overnight m&eacute;nage. At least that's the reason she gives herself.A delightful romance, that includes a threesome affair, that may lead to more.

2847,"This one is a really hard one to rate. I will say it now holds the record for the book that kept me up the latest ( three thirty in the morning for heaven's sake! I just couldn't put it down.) The suspense and mystery parts of the story were SO GOOD but the romance and overall moral of the story was SO frustrating!There were really only two problems (ok, the writing wasn't top notch in places but that can be over looked), the first is concerning the romance between Jack and Bella. Jack is a hired assassin who has been in love with Bella for 10 years, she is in love with him also but they have kept their relationship on the best friend level because of his profession. When things blow apart and they find themselves on the run and fighting for their (and their loved ones) lives, their relationship takes a major turn bringing all the feelings to the forefront. Jack has been holding out in a big way, however, and Bella starts to uncover all the lies and deceit he has been employing against her (in order to ""protect"" her). At least 5 or 6 times the topic is brought up with both the characters stating they will need to discuss and work these problems out between them. Jack must explain his reasons to Bella before she can ever trust him again. With all the action, however, these HUGE issues never get resolved, they have been the elephant in the room through half the stinking book and it NEVER HAPPENS! They just smile and walk off into the sunset together. AGH!!!!The other problem is probably personal. The killer for hire concept with the killer, who murders whoever he's hired to just for the big money, and with no remorse whatsoever, being the ""hero""- along with the contradictory plot where he is saving the son who's family have been assassinated by he and his associates just doesn't sit well. If there had been any redemption or remorse or change in attitude it would have worked for me. As it was, all good and bad just became a very dark gray. All were bad, the ones you root for are getting paid to kill indiscriminately, the ones you want to lose are also getting paid to kill indiscriminately, they're just trying to kill the ones we're rooting for. In the end, even the heroine goes to the dark side. Ick",neutral,book

7578,"My Favorite of the series.  It is the story of Esme Canville and St John Radwell.  St John was the villain in the first book of the series, The Inconvenient Duchess.  In the years since the last novel, St John has transformed himself and is in the process of making himself into a respectable person.  Esme, however, is looking for the villain.  In order to avoid the arranged marriage her father has planned for her, Esme seeks St john to compromise her.  St John, however, delivers her to his brother (with whom he continues to have a strained relationship).  As could be expected, however, Esme and St John become involved in a relationship.I enjoyed this book because of the character of St john.  I really disliked him in the first book and almost stopped reading the book because of him.  However, he has completely redeemed himself and I was deeply interested in how he has remade himself but still has to deal with his past.  His care and consideration of Esme despite his temptation demonstrates how his character has changed.The book is a lighter read and is not overly complicated or intense, but I enjoyed it and recommend it.",neutral,book
560,"I enjoyed the story and David's parallel story lines were easy to follow.  However, it was clear that he has little &#34;real&#34; experience in shipboard life or with military structure and command personalities.  All of his characters are exagerated stereotypes and the interpersonal exchanges would have resulted in few of these protagonists ever reaching command because of the obvious psycholoogical abberations present.One sure indicator of his unfamiliarity with naval (spaceship or surfaceship) life is his lubberly use of &#34;the&#34; before ship names.  We who have spent many years and many deck watches know that a manned ship is truly a living entity, christened at its birth (launching), and possessing the nature and personality of its officers and crew.  Use of &#34;the&#34; before its given name is akin to referring to this book's author as &#34;the David Derrico.&#34;Also, as Isaac Azimov pointed out repeatedly, good science fiction must be good science.  I was appalled when the good Admiral referred to &#34;a new element&#34; as part of the alien hull.  Any &#34;new element&#34; in this universe would necessarily be very unstable with a half life measured in nano-seconds so can't be fairly used withhout first laying the appropriate background work.

It may not look great but it will get you from point A to B. Whoever wrote this book clearly doesn't get what it's like to struggle for money.She's obsessed about her high priced shoes but if she was so worried about having money to eat or survive she would sell those on craigslist or ebay.

I almost always enjoy her stories to a varying degree, from good to very good except this story.  Oh...and except Velvet Cataclysm which I didn't like at all. Her writing style in this book is a bit like poetry in the way she uses her words.  Okay maybe not poetry but I don't know the word to describe it so here is an example. ""The amount of incendiary material he'd built up for Grace must have been monumental."" See what I mean?  The whole story is written like this, different.Now on to my thoughts about this story.First off Grace is NOT Trick's mother-in-law.  She was married to Trick's father Evan, so she is his stepmother!  Grace is described as his mother-in-law several times in the story, talk about confusing and not a good start to this book.  This story did get a bit better as it unfolded and the characters took shape for me.Trick was an asshat to Grace from the word go.  Grace was a strong, assertive woman with everyone but...Trick.  For the most part, Grace was Tricks whippy post, figuratively speaking that is--and she let him.  That's the part I disliked most, her hypnotic like acceptance of his treatment.  I understood it sure and it was explained at the end but I don't have to like it though.Then there was the mad dash to the end of the story where explanations' and secrets were revealed.  His reaction to these secrets was not what I expected meaning not much of a reaction.  No outrage or anger. The ending was just too rushed for me. I needed more closure.",neutral,book

84,"Heat of the Moment is the first book in the Out of Uniform series by author Elle Kennedy.If you are looking for a full length novel, look elsewhere.  This novella is just that -- a short story.  It comes in  at 78 pages according to Amazon and I want to mention that it is even shorter than that since the last 10 percent maybe of the book is previews for other stories.This is a sexy and short M/F/M menage read.  The main couple is John Garrett and Shelby Harper with the third person involved is Carson Scott. After pining for each other for a year, Shelby finally invites John and Carson up to her place after closing time.  She had the cafe open during a heat wave for the service men and she over hears Carson and John talking about how vanilla Shelby probably is.  Shelby is convinced to show them how un-vanilla she is by acting out her fantasy of two men at one time.I really enjoyed this short story and the writer made it believable.  While Carson was more of a third wheel in the story, he was a pivotal player in getting these two together.  Even though it does feature instant love after one night together with a small glitch of insecurities, I could actually see these two people together for the long haul.While it was in no means a book that will be above others, I will say that this short story was a great start to being introduced to this author for the first time.

9097,"This decently entertaining short novel is the first installment of Guido Henkel's supernatural adventure series starring his Jason Dark, Ghost Hunter creation.  Though the writing in this self-published offering is sometimes a little repetitive and clunky, it never sinks to sloppy or slapdash levels.  Besides, the scene setting and descriptions of Victorian London more than compensate: both aspects are moody and effective, nicely drawing the reader into Henkel's world of demons and supernatural investigation.My other criticisms are basically quibbles. I would have liked to see more dialogue between Dark and his supporting cast members; it would have enabled us to get to know everyone a little better, as well as break up the large blocks of dense description (usually of streets and buildings) in the prose.  Also, an occasional plot twist or dramatic revelation would have punched things up a little, especially at the end, where all we get is a long fight scene (though not a bad one).  But, again, I liked the moody, creepy vibe Henkel delivers throughout, and more importantly, I cared about Jason Dark and the people around him.From reading Mr. Henkel's book description here on Amazon (as well as his recent blog postings), I learned that I apparently just missed a revised version of ""Demon's Night"", which includes a new cover, a lower price, and a polishing of the prose.  So the most recent version of this book might be better than I'm giving it credit for here.  It's certainly cheaper.Will I come back for more?  Sure.  While perhaps lacking the crispness and total polish of a novel one might pick up at your local book store, the sudden availability of interesting self-published offerings like Guido Henkel's Jason Dark books on the Kindle more than compensates for any slight shortcomings in the final product, at least in this case.And, as we all well know, it's not like ""officially"" published books are perfect, either.",neutral,book

356,"In the hands of a gifted writer, this original ghost story could have been hilariously entertaining.  With this writer, not so much.  As other reviewers have said, this reads like a very sketchy description of a book, rather than the book itself. None of the characters are believable or relatable, the plot lurches along without much sense or description and, oh yeah, there is a lot of gratuitous vulgar language. I am very glad that I downloaded this for free from Amazon's lineup and did not spend actual money on it. Thankfully, this was a a short read; but it really is not worth the effort.",neutral,book

5385,"Since I hadn't read anything with this character previously I will address both the content and the formatting.Kindle formatting and navigation:  Linked table of contents to the individual books and anthologies (nice) but not to the chapters within the books (would've been nice to have).  Scalable font.  The pictures were a bit wasted on the six inch screen but they were nice to have on the PC app.  All in all formatting is a 4.5 out of 5, the half star being deducted for the lack of chapter links.Content:  I enjoyed meeting Dr. Thorndyke and Dr. Jervis but I didn't get as attached to them as to, say, Poirot or Miss Marple or Sherlock Holmes.  There was much less of ""them"" present in the works... although the fact that Dr. Thorndyke never quite figured out how inept Dr. Jervis was grated a little... maybe I am too used to watching Poirot and Holmes watch indulgently as Hastings and Watson bumble along to believe anyone could be blind to his inadequacies.  The mysteries themselves were generally pretty decent, and the detective work was quite interesting.  Of the three long tales one of the three was incredibly predictable, and two of the three were moderately predictable.  The short stories were far more enjoyable although they were also mostly predictable.  They were fun and kept me reading more so than the novels did.  If I had to guess at the goal of the author just from these four works I would have to say that he was trying to illustrate new methods of detection and problem solving in an entertaining way much more than he was trying to tell stories about interesting characters.  Novels 3.5 stars.  Short stories 4 stars.Decent read.  Might try to find some other short story collections with these characters.",neutral,book

I don't think I made it past five chapters before giving up. The main character is completely stupid. Why go running in the forest you know has demons in it and then when you meet the demon what do you do? Make out with him. Yea so believable. Not to much the writer writes like she has adhd.

As I said originally, the premise of this book is intriguing, I was all set and determined to love this book.  Some of the character development was a little jerky and the constant waffling by the Maria character was just downright annoying.  She is the main reason that I originally stopped reading the book, but there were other decisions made with characters that were puzzling or overly sterotyped: did we really need another athiest/pedophile priest?I have seen other reviewers say that reading the other books in the series brings everything together and that they were happier after seeing the work as a whole, so I will go on to the next book and see how it goes from there.  I am one of those people who HAS to finish a book, so the fact that I was ready to give up on it at 80% of the way though says a lot.  The last 20% of the book was much better than the middle of it was!I do have to say that I didn't notice very many typos, as another reviewer stated, though there were some statements that had me stuck for a while.  At one point, a woman is said to have a ""thick African-American accent.""  What the heck is that?  As an African-American, I wasn't aware of us having our own accent, we tend to go with the accent of the region we live in, so maybe the author meant African, or West African or something like that.

6498,"I liked this book, but I didn't love it. There were some pacing issues for me. Also, I liked the characters, well I liked Lorenzo, and I am ambivalent about Sandalini.This book featured an SFPD detective, Gabriel Sandalini, and an FBI agent, Antonio Lorenzo who went deep undercover to bust a mexican drug cartel. From the beginning, Lorenzo & Sandlini were drawn to each other, but they were unaware that the other was one of the good guys.So they fought their attraction because 1) it was disturbing being attracted to such a bad character and 2) there would be no future as betrayal and arrests were inevitable.Unfortunately, one of them got their cover blown. Now they are in the fight of their lives. It's hard to even focus on love, when you have to watch your back against everyone.I never connected with Sandalini. He was a reckless smart mouth kid. He wasn't as tough as he thought he was. He was annoying. then I didn't understand how a hardened agent like Lorenzo could be so sensitive when he comes to Sandalini. I like them together but something was missing for me. I think it was the writing. It was too sterile for me. the only real show of emotion from Sandalini was a prelude to sex or during sex or post sex. Whereas Lorenzo wore his heart on his sleeve. I don't know how the heck Lorenzo made it as an FBI undercover agent. He is too nice. I would have liked him to be vocal with Gabriel. I will read book 2 to see they are progressing.",neutral,book

I don't really like the whole demon thing going on in this book, but because the author made it a whole new world it made it easier to swallow.  I normally like more romance but I can see that the author is setting up the next book to have more.  My only real complaint is that it was somewhat confusing at times with all the names.

There's also something that made me almost mad: Will's colleague is expecting him for dinner to set him up with her brother, he knows he has to go, but then he is caught up in his confrontation with Ethan and that fact is not mentioned anymore. I know one can't expect everything to be tied up, but what was the point? There was something good and intense in the story, but there was also something over-the-top and not deep enough.

4912,"I recently read Dandelions in the Garden by Charlie Courtland, and became an instant fan of her storytelling. So, naturally I was very much looking forward to reading the book's sequel, The Hidden Will of the Dragon. Unfortunately, I was barely two chapters in when I realized this novel would be nothing like the first and was greatly disappointed as I continued to read.The main characters from Dandelions in the Garden, had stopped evolving with the ending of that book and instead digressed into hollow players in this drawn out and lackluster novel. The way the story was told had changed and by doing so, lost all appeal for me. There were also far too many errors throughout this book for me to over look. I had noticed some in the previous story but didn't pay much attention to them since the story itself provided a satisfying read, but Hidden Will of the Dragon was completely riddled with them! I understand this falls partly on the editor, or lack of one if that's the case, but either way it should have been picked through and polished before publishing.Hidden Will picks up where Dandelions left off but doesn't flow along with the original story quite right. I had grown fond of Amara, Elizabeth's lady in waiting, admiring her strong will and ability to keep her head when everything around her was falling to pieces. I had enjoyed reading about her romances and her troubles, about her marriage and the strong bond she and her husband had between them. In this book, there isn't a bit of that. Amara is weak, needy and someone I ended up not being able to stand. And then there's Elizabeth, who I no longer sympathized with and just like with Amara, couldn't tolerate. She was out of her mind, annoyingly self centered and her actions were pointless.I feel absolutely awful having to leave this review! I enjoyed the first book and had assumed the second would be an accurate follow up but it fell flat, very flat. The story was there, and could have been saved and written in a way where the reader still felt attached to the characters they had connected with before, instead of having to read far too many pages without being able to absorb it. I'm sure there are many readers out there who enjoyed this book, and I'm glad that they did! This is just my opinion and I know that doesn't mean others will share it, but I have to say that I do not recommend this read.",neutral,book

She was an enjoyable character to follow and easy to identify with.If you are looking for a fun, hot and definitely sexy read to fill in an hour or so, then be sure to pick up a copy of this erotic romance.

2646,"(May contain spoilers)The book starts out solid and interesting. Then in the middle everything shifts and explodes into a bad plot twist. When I read the summary and it mentioned gods I figured it would be figurative, however they were not. This author put flat out religious, ridiculous, prophetic god characters into what began as a solid space apocalypse plot. It's just way too much.To have the apocalypse happen in a dystopian future while also throwing in some space tech walks a fine line between a great story plot and having too much going on. The author was doing quite well until deciding it was time to throw the whole thing off a cliff, kill off a bunch of characters, add an unconvincing romance, and let loose a ""twist"" in the form of gods who are suddenly the reason behind the apocalypse. Additionally the main character goes from being a fairly strong female character who holds no belief in religion to bring a forlorn, love struck, weakling who laments death and embraces the ""goddess"" that claims her. Nonsense.The only reason this gets two stars is because the first half of the book was a solid story. Before it went off to crazy land I was intrigued and excited to finish the book. The ""teaser chapter"" at the end of the book promises that the next book will be even worse than the last half of this one, so I won't even bother. Sad to see such a promising plot get blown up in the efforts of an author to reach beyond the limits of their plot line.

I read little that gave me the impression that Keira and Will were going to have a happily every after, where love and trust abounded.The sex scenes were graphic, and the language explicit.

But there were hints of so much more that just didn't get to be fully explored.I'm giving this book 4 stars because I really had fun reading it- DESPITE the fact that there seemed to be a hell of a lot more to the story than what I got. The book is definitely a romance- and I always enjoy a good paranormal romance, but there was just so much ELSE going on that it was almost a shame to spend so much time focused on the attraction between our two characters.I can't wait to read the second book, but I find myself drawn into the greater context of the world and hope to get more from the next books than just the romance. Lots of questions are left unanswered and the author makes interesting interpretations of standard paranormal mythos. I'd love to know more...Bottom line- good book. The story itself is fun. The characters are likeable and strong. The universe is interesting. I just wish it was maybe a little longer so that I didn't have to settle for all the HINTING Ms. Somers did at the larger context.

A book within a book. I loved that concept and I think it was executed quite well.As a fantasy novel there is the quest aspect of the story, and that takes us into a magical land with spirits, magicians, and an enemy of the queen who has his own minion army. One part of the book that is memorable, to me at least, was the Evil Army Recruitment Questionnaire. It just made me laugh (e.g. one of the questions was ""Do you like to play with fire?"" and the two options were ""Yes"" and ""Yes!"").Bethany, our main character, is quite young seeming and naive. She's hiding something that comes to light part way through the story and I just couldn't believe what I was reading. It actually really turned me off the book. I was enjoying the fantasy narrative, but then we found out about this secret she was hiding and it was absolutely insane. I can't be specific about it because it would be a major spoiler, but it just made me wonder where Bethany's brain was at, it was so ludicrous.Some scenes in 'Running From Secrets' seemed almost rushed through, while others were well paced and thought out. Therefore sometimes I was really into the book and wanted to see where the story was going, and other times I was a little bored. Overall I thought the book came to a pretty satisfying conclusion, and I think it's worth reading for the interesting story within a story and world creation.",neutral,book
1603,"Realizing that his and his wife's life are threatened by a terror organization, Paul Benante stages secretly his death. The plan is so secret that his wife Jolene doesn't know anything about it and isn't involved in its realization. However, she has to pick up the bits and pieces of her life, has to get used to the idea of being a widow and has to try to go on with her life.Six years after the death of her husband Jolene is a successful deputy marshal on an elite warrant team but her private life still suffers - she hasn't been involved with any man after her husband's death. Then, all of a sudden, Paul's worst fears seem to come true: an attempt on Jolene's life is made and Paul decides to ""secure"" his wife by taking her to the high security military base he is working. But what thinks Jolene about her husband's ""resurrection""?I would've liked to elaborate more on above summary but was really afraid to spoil too much since the plot was simple and straight forward, without creating any mentionable ups and downs. Except for few pages at the beginning of the novel, the whole book took place in the secret military base. Furthermore, the book didn't have any serious sub-characters, except for two of Jolene's colleagues and one of Paul's, who all made very rare and unmentionable appearances.  That wouldn't really matter if the interaction between the two main characters would've been outstanding and making the change in scenery and characters needless, which really wasn't the case, especially since Paul's  main target was completely one dimensional: he wanted only to get her into his bed and she couldn't resist.The more I read about Paul the less I liked him. By choosing his career he very consciously made the decision to lead a solitarily and withdrawn life, gaining in return for this sacrifice self-fulfillment through his academic achievements. Basically he made the very active decision to barter his private life for his professional life. So far so good, until he decides to marry Jolene against his better knowledge and for one reason only: he wants to get her into his bed.

The main characters, however, were very well drawn and fully realized.....I would like to see them in a follow-up.

And although the victim wasn't well liked, she had enough money so she didn't care. And Aggie, of course, has the coolest head and figures out the mixed up mess.This was a bit muddled, and the badly edited grammer did nothing but detract from the story, partially because the mistake (primarily with plurals and possesives and apostrophes) weren't even consistant.I  wouldn't go out of my way to find any others in the series, but might read another if I ran across it.

8343,"After reading the other reviews I purchased this title and was disappointed.  This isn't a different story and the characters were poorly developed.  The slaves at Cascade (and in this society), don't ""choose"" to be slaves in the sense that they have options.  Generally, in this society if you don't have a job or training you become a slave.  Alex, is an anomaly in that he one of the few who chooses slavery because of his specific sexual needs and he is older-47 years old.  He has a trade, makes a living but his submissive nature calls him to slavery.  His situation is very different than most of the other slaves we meet:  Noah, Jackson, and Gavin.  Gavin's experience as a slave led him to refuse to even consider owning a slave until Alex comes along.  And this is a huge problem in the continuity of the character development of Gavin.  Alex is the first slave he's trained who is actually choosing to become a slave when he has more attractive alternatives (from Gavin's point of view).  As a result, he's overprotective, holds back and goes ""easy"" on Alex while trying to convince him that slavery is the wrong choice for him.  None of this makes sense-why does Gavin choose to help out the one person who is looking forward to becoming a slave and would happily go with any of the men who take him for a test drive-the rougher the better.  One would think that he would have chosen, before this point,  to help out someone in dire straits-terrified, young, no options, but not Gavin he waits until someone comes to him who has options, is old enough to make a decision and indeed has thought about it and is only offering a 6 month contract so if this gig doesn't work out he can go back to his trade.  Very different than many of the other slaves we meet who have years of slavery to look forward to-again it would make more sense to help one of those people out.I did enjoy the relationship between Sam and Gavin, it was friendly and loving but given that they both had dominant natures I found it very odd, and hard to believe, that they didn't have a third in their relationship, someone very submissive to offset their dominance.  Sure, for the most part Sam let Gavin dominate him, but he wasn't really satisfied with that-as we see in the scene with Jackson when Demetri says ""how have you lived without this""?  I think, as readers, we're supposed to understand that this has been missing from Sam and Gavin's relationship and Alex's presence in their home would provide this. But again, that person did not have to be a slave. Alex would have been happy to go to Michael, Demetri even Brian and Rhys.  He wasn't looking for love, he wanted to be hurt and any of those men would have been happy to provide that.  I thought it was hilarious when they called Alex ""boy"" he was 47 years old for crying out loud!So the big conflict-Gavin not wanting to own a slave because he hated his time in slavery made no sense because Alex wanted to be a slave and Gavin worked as a fricking slave trainer, he had no problem, no conflict with his job.  And he was acting like an owner because he was totally ignoring Alex's desires.  Sam's arguments in favor of Alex making his own choices were good ones, but he was a fricking slave owner.  He only stopped owning slaves when he hooked up with Gavin-he had no problem using slaves whether or not they choose to be in the situation or not.  I felt like the author was trying to write Sam and Gavin as empathic and fair and totally missed the mark-they were poorly fleshed out and delusional.However, Alex was consistent and well developed.  The character of Demetri was fascinating.",neutral,book

2000,"This is Jules Verne's classic tale of undersea adventure, as best I can tell based on the 1873 translation by Lewis Mercier. Since that's been the standard English translation for over a hundred years, it's probably the one you remember reading way back when, and the edition you'll be familiar with.Re-reading this as an adult, and an adult who's spent twenty-plus years since then reading science fiction, I did have to remind myself more than once how amazing the then-future technologies Verne describes, like electric rifles, undersea diving suits, electric motors, etc., would have been to his contemporary readers; the book was first published in 1869, a mere five years after the Confederate submarine Hunley became the first submarine to sink an enemy warship (and sank itself in the process).  At times I found myself mentally substituting ""outer space"" for ""under sea,"" just to help me analogize the situation. Despite that,  the plot and action were as riveting now as they were when I first read it twenty years ago. I did find myself, now as then, skimming over much of Verne's extensive scientific descriptions of undersea flora and fauna, etc., but that might be my own failing as a reader -- when I did take the time to read Verne's descriptions, I did sometimes catch the same sense of aquatic wonder I remember from watching films like _The Life Aquatic_.From what I've read, the Mercier translation this is based on contains a number of translation errors, cuts out about 20% of the text, etc. Corrected, completed, updated ebook editions of this classic are available on Amazon, but they cost money -- I've been unable to find an out-of-copyright, corrected, complete, and free edition. For readers on a budget, though, this is probably the version you remember, and if read in the right way -- keeping in mind the era in which it was written, and skimming whenever the science gets too dry or detailed for you -- it's still quite entertaining.Verne did write a sequel, _The Mysterious Island_, also available in the kindle free store; the better translation is available here:The Mysterious Island.",neutral,book
6358,"These stories were described as ""pulp"", and I would never have guessed that I'd enjoy them, but I did!  Immensely!  All 4 stories in this collection take place in the mid-1920's and have a definite 'feel' to them that is characteristic of the era.  Most of the mysteries set in this time period in Britain tend to focus more on the lives of the (usually upper-class) characters and only secondarily on the mystery.  These books put the mystery front and center, and while Drummond is definitely upper-class in terms of being comfortably off financially and without a need for 'gainful' employment, he's not nobility and he doesn't hobnob with the landed gentry.  In our day and age, he'd be considered middle-class, and this gives the stories a sense of familiarity.There's a great deal of action, and violence - but it's fistfight and rough-and-tumble violence, not blood and guts like so many modern tales.  It's the violence of a refined, genteel world that still remembers the eye-opening shock of WWI as a salutatory lesson in man's inhumanity to man.IMO, the first 3 stories were much stronger and more likeable than the 4th, which is told in a different 'tone' and 'voice, but the tales themselves are very well done and interesting.  There's a common thread running between all 4 stories in this book, so they lead one to another.  All were excellent examples of the writer's art from the time period, and still have considerable appeal today.  Highly recommended!  There is also a volume 2  with 3 or 4 more books collected to show the further adventures of Bulldog (who I must say is an extremely likeable character!).Note on Kindle formatting:  Very good.  I couldn't find any issues with the first 3 books in this collection.  The 4th wasn't anywhere near as good - there were many OCR errors, which did slow down reading somewhat, though not to the point where the book was difficult to read.",neutral,book

3027,"To preface my review, I will definitely say that this book was very well written for a such a short read. The main characters are Jayda who is able to shift to both a wolf and a cougar, her boyfriend Cole - a wolf, and Zane a cougar shifter. As the story excerpt indicates her boyfriend Cole brings out the wolf in her and through his help (intimately) she is able to shift to a wolf, however with him her cougar is latent and vice versa, with Zane she is able to shift to a cougar and with him her wolf is latent. Thse are both men who are head of their respective councils and have a deep-seated distrust for each other..you can see where this is leading!Naturally as the audience, we are privy to Jayda's feelings and the sense of disquiet she feels because although Cole wants to mate with her and she loves him, she is unable to commit to him because she is not only a wolf. We get that she loves Cole and she is torn, especially after meeting Zane, being sexually attracted to him and shifting with him. Ultimately it came to a head where she wants/needs both of them to complete her. I had a problem with the way the author wrote Jayda's reaction when she brought the two men together and had sex with them. I felt like it was all about her...I thought that Jayda's character was selfish because Cole was never given enough time to actually come around to the idea that Jayda's polymorphic state meant that both her animals needed mates. It was like she was there at the finish line in knowing what she needed to feel happy and instead of giving him the time to come around so he could meet her there, she was angry that there was jealous and resentment on his part. Ultimately it worked out, but because I felt disconnected from Jayda, it ruined the story for me!On another note, can anyone recommend an author or books where the opposite happens? What I mean is that I am tired of the same old alien, cyborg, vampire, shifter relationships where the same theme abounds...way too much men and not enough women to go around so of course there is the lucky female with two (or three) hunks after her. I would like to read about a FFM relationship where there is an alien, cyborg, vampire, shifter theme where more females than male presiding and there is a lucky guy who's got two (or three) beauties loving him!!",neutral,book
9735,"Though Aidn and Bailey have crossed paths at a fetish club they both belong to, the first real meeting opens the story. The conversation is a bit stilted and awkward but totally fits the situation and shows how human both characters are. Neither of them is willing to end the encounter, though, because they can both feel the electricity and desire that arcs between them. The heat between them explodes when they're alone and they can't keep their hands off of each other. Though the sex is great, the intense emotion it contains scares Aidn. His fear and uncertainty make him an extremely endearing character. Likewise, Bailey's determination about Aidn being the one for her proves her strength of character. Watching the two of them dance around the relationship they could have if they let themselves makes this story fun to read.Lissa Matthews has written a really enjoyable story with an ending that won't disappoint.

She throws herself at St John to escape. The plot follows their romance. I found this well written but it failed to make magic for me. Perhaps this was partly because St John was not so likeable in the first book which I read quite recently and therefore could not make the switch to like him. Perhaps it was Esme who just kept throwing herself at him and despite several attempts to get close which failed, still did not really appear to be looking at alternatives seriously to escape what awaited her where she to return home.

By then, I was in a hurry to move on to another book.WOLF SIGNS is the first book of the Granite Lake Wolves series. Even though this book was a quick read, I won't be continuing on with the series. This author has other books that have been recommended by friends. I'd like to try another one, maybe one with a little bit more action.",neutral,book
7392,"4 starsThis was a very good story. I liked Julia, Hunter and Jay and how they came together. A hot read but with good emotional content as well. :)Julia is a pharmaceutical rep in Sidney. She's smart and well balanced and seems to have it all together. Julia was raised a good girl and her family expects her to get married and have kids. Julia has no idea what she's supposed to do when realizes that she's fallen in love with 2 men and she can't figure out which one she loves more.Jay is also a pharmaceutical rep in Sidney. He and Julia have known each other for about a year but Jay was involved with someone at the time. By the time he was free, Hunter had come in to the picture and Jay didn't make a move because of him.Hunter is a product manager from another pharmaceutical company and part the poker club that Jay invites Julia to join. He also wants Julia but doesn't move in because of Jay. I liked both Hunter and Jay, they're good guys and both like Julia a lot.The ice breaks on the careful detente that the trio has going a couple of weeks before Christmas when they're the only one's left at the poker game. Julia end up sharing a few kisses with both men but leaves after that and is unsure of herself, avoiding both men for the next week. She talks about her issues with her sister but it still comes back to the fact that she could never bring 2 men home to her family. When she gets to poker night the week before Christmas, she finds that it was cancelled (although she didn't get a message) and she ends up alone with Jay and Hunter. Jay and Hunter take the chance to get her in their arms again and once there, Julia can't think of getting out. After that night, the trio spends every night together and when Julia spends Christmas day with her family, she's torn because she can't stand the idea of losing Hunter and/or Jay but she doesn't know if she could get her family to accept it. Her sister does find out though and wants to meet Jay and Hunter, seeming willing to give them a chance so it doesn't seem impossible.As Julia begins to realize she seriously wants something long-term including all 3 of them, she wonders how the men are feeling. They prove to be just as interesting in making their trio long term as she's thinking but they all take some time to explore things and don't share with the families yet. This ends up being a good thing as there are more relationship landmines to navigate, including the unexpected attraction that comes out between Hunter and Jay, and Hunter's subsequent freak out about it. Julia manages to talk Hunter down and with Jay and Julia's help, Hunter starts to come to terms with some things. They start bonding even closer as a trio and spend New Years eve together and have some explosive sex and some emotional bonding. In the end, Hunter, Jay and Julia agree to tell their families and work their relationship in to something permanent and they start their HEA.This was very good. I really liked the characters and the story was really well done. It didn't seem as short as it was and I felt the sexual content was well balanced with the emotions as the trio came together. I'd recommend this story. Thumbs up! :D",neutral,book

1716,"So this is totally over the top &#34;beef cake&#34; erotica.  Yes , I did finish it.  Yes, I think the author has done a pretty good job.  I did skim arts of it, however.  We meet a beautiful young woman that is saved by a caring older man via a platonic marriage. The opening scene is this h enjoying a dip in a river while unbeknownst to her, Devon, our H, is watching her lustfully from the trees.  The H is the son of her husband.  He was raised by his aunts after his mother died and the Father felt  unprepared to raise him by himself. Devon is later kidnapped and raised by a band of lawless men.  Devon is tough, dominant and ...yes...gorgeous .....and huge...in every way.....hence.....the cannon references.  As the story opens, Devon is on his way to see the Father he does not remember because he has been sent a message that the old man is dying.Devon,totally hot.  I dug his alpha ways and the sex scenes in which he is totally dom like.  I did feel sorry for the secondary male in the story, the doctor. There are some threesome scenes and the doc is more or less a foil to show how dom-like Devon is to the whole dynamic.I must admit, I read this book several weeks ago and cannot remember the heroine's name. Forgive me.  This is a long book. I paid a dollar for it and it is worth it.  The author attempts to make this more than just erotica by giving us a bigger story in which we follow the Hero on his trail ride to hunt and kill some fathomless bad guys.  This part I skimmed.  But  this is a sexy, erotic read if this is what you want.  Do not expect a deep introspective or thought provoking read.

2163,"I have a hard time reading on-line for enjoyment and I don't own one of those portable readers yet.  That's to explain why it took me quite a long time to read this volume.Once I did get to reading, I found this book virtually hard to put down.  Sage is a wonderful fantasy kingdom described for the reader by the main character. Demetria is a plant wizard with the ability to control and speak to plant life, which does tend to make them grow very well.  Her husband, Ward, is a dungeon master who can control stone.All of the inhabitants of Sage have some type of magical affinity, whether to plants, stone, animals, and a variety of other talents.The Rats who live in a neighboring kingdom, however, are not amiable with the humans of Sage.  Therein lies much of the conflict in these stories. In the first tale, the Rats have sent a plague of rotten mold into Sage.  Who better to fight this menace than Demetria, the master gardener? With great personal sacrifice, Demetria, assisted by other wizards, fights off the slime threatening her land.In the second story, Demetria and Ward must rescue their son from the Rat Kingdom. They get some surprising help from those believed to be the guilty parties.Okay, I'm writing this review before I've read the third tale, however, I will absolutely do so and know I will enjoy the heck out of it.  I've become a Demetria fan.  I look forward to seeing more tales from the land of Sage.  But, Maria, let's get this book in print so I can take it to bed with me.

3165,"The first thing that grabbed me about this book was definitely the title. I found it intriguing & mysterious, and it made me really excited to get into it. And as you read the story, you realize that Bethany (our main character) not only has to keep a lot of secrets, but she discovers even more.I really wanted to give this book 5 stars, but there were a few things that held it back. The story confused me a bit at times, and never quite explained how it was that Bethany could be in two worlds at once. Also, at some points in the book, Bethany spoke in a way that made her sound way too old for her age - especially in her interactions with her siblings.BUT what I did love about this book was the imagination and creativity that went into Chime's world. I loved the idea of an author falling into her world, and especially a world filled with magic & mystery.

I love books that help me relax and that are easy to read- Secrets was certainly one of those books!The opening of the book caught my attention and from there, I knew I would have no problem reading to the very last page. I needed to know what was going on and I wanted everything to work out for these mysterious characters! They were well written, believable and easy to empathise with. Tess, while admittedly silly and impulsive, was a fun character and I found it easy to like her. Joe definitely took some getting used to and I still don't think he's the nicest guy around but I grew to accept the way he was and his nice side completely shone by the end!Was Secrets amazing? Not really, but it was very good. It had one or two things that bugged for. I think it was dragged out too much and could have been condensed down by at least a hundred pages. I also really wasn't feeling the relationship between Tess and her daughter. It felt like Em wasn't really there most of the time and Tess didn't really seem to engage with her. Other than those two things, I thought it was an immensely enjoyable book and at no point was I bored or contemplating stopping.Secrets is certainly worthy of four stars and I am eager to read more of Freya North's work in the future as I do think she has talent.",neutral,book

6794,"Maybe it isn't fair to start a review by complaining of the excessive length of this fascinating story.  But even Red Adept in her review highlights that problem right at the start.  And, to be fair. from about 60% of the way through the book I kept wondering when it would ever end.  So the extreme and unnecessary length was a key factor in my reading this book.Now, to be clear, I love long novels.  My favorite book (Tai-Pan by James Clavell) is over 700 pages.  This book I would estimate at about 650 pages (it is 14800+ locations on the Kindle).  And I continually read long books, but mostly in historical fiction- NOT action/adventure.  Those books are usually about 350-450 pages, which would have been the right length for this book.  Only Tom Clancy writes such long action thrillers (like Debt of Honor), but even those books are too long, and he is a best selling author- not a new writer.  So this book needed substantial trimming- I'd reduce it by at least 25% and probably closer to 35%.  There are only so many times you need to read about the characters escaping from the villains.Now, having complained about the length, I will state that the plot was terrific- Mozart in the 21st century, escaping death in the 1790's by the modern day evil company's time machine that brought him to today.  And, then, with his love interest Elisse, trying to escape from their clutches.  I would have preferred more about his music, but the portrayal of Mozart was quite fun.  It is very evident to me that the author based his characterization on Tom Hulce's performance in the movie ""Amadeus"".  (Note that in the book the movie is mentioned several times- so this connection is no accident).I must mention one fantastic scene where Mozart gets into a fiddle contest against Rainman in a honky tonk bar in New Orleans- Mozart plays his Stradivarius.  A real hoot!The time travel aspects, and the back story of the evil company and its device and manipulations are never revealed much- and that is OK.  The emphasis is on Mozart and his escape from his imprisonment.In short, I liked the book,and the premise very much- but the  book was much too long.  A major trimming would have helped enormously. (I downgraded it one star for the length.)A final word on the Kindle formatting.  I did not find it as troubling as the previous reviewers.  There were some errors, but not that many.",neutral,book
3356,"I thought this was a somewhat unique twist on the reluctant wolf bride theme (though maybe I just don't read a lot of the hunter books).  Syd's never felt in tune with her hunter father, who is a major redneck bully werewolf hunter (hey, I'm from the mountains, I can say that).  She falls for a wolf, of course, who sees her and knows she's his mate. There is quite a bit of humor, actually, which really carries this story, I think.  Spoiler: Daddy forces hunk and daughter on some hunts which are funny and scary, and ultimately girl turns into wolf, Daddy tries to lock her up and &#34;cure&#34; her, almost kills the hunk, a gay wolf friend, and a cross-dressing pseudo-psychic.  In the end, Daddy comes only halfway round, and our heroine runs off with her hunk to have wolf pups.  Honestly, I kinda wondered if the author wasn't making more of a point about prejudices and homophobia than writing a steamy romance.  Not that I mind.  It was fairly well-written and funny and the plot moved well.  The talking dog bit was rather cumbersome, though.  Overall, not bad for the price.

2824,"One of the things I love so much about paranormal/fantasy novels is their amazing attention to detail.  Worlds beyond comprehension are created and characters, with otherwise impossible abilities, are summoned up from the imaginarium of the authors mind.Now, all that being said I was pretty excited by the idea of a ""paranormal-magic tracking"" private investigator, unfortunately having a fantastic idea doesn't always equal great execution.For those of you who have ever watched a film noir  or noir shorts you will easily understand the format for ""Tracking Magic (Max Killian Investigations)"" Here was a novel that was written as a series of short stories which are (when you break it down) actually case files for the PI Max Killian, (a somewhat blase' middle-aged investigator who -to be honest- makes a brick wall sound exciting.)After Schnieder's 1st story ""Haunting Clues"",  (which I thought ended abruptly and had no substance) I was certain things would get better... there was just so much potential there, but instead of getting better, (expanding the personal attributes of Max or even bringing in references of older cases) the stories just...stayed the same. They were (in places) mildly entertaining, but the obvious repetition in the beginning of each story ( yes - I get it, you don't tell people you can smell magic because then you will be taxed by the government) had me tuning out.Would I count ""Schnieder"" out of the writers talent pool? No... she just needs to focus more on where she wants her ""Hero"" to go.Do I think ""Tracking Magic"" is worth the time? Well since it only took me 2 and a half hours to read, sure... I'm just not all that sure I'd want to pay $2.00 for that 2 hours.Read if you have NOTHING else.Happy reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: The IRS eventually finds everyone.. there is no point in hiding... they are like a bad case of Ebola with no vaccine.",neutral,book
6500,"After a long introduction about the downfall of the horror novel, how few horror stories they are left, and how this book had ""real, haunting horror"", I was preparing myself for a collection of really stellar, frightening short stories, and instead I got... well, while none of them are what I would call poorly written, they also aren't what I would call particularly memorable or scary in the slightest. Nearly every story herein is some sort of ghost story, but it's less ""The Grudge"" and more ""here are some ghosts, they have some unfinished business, but they're trapped, sorta, and that's sad I guess?"" It should be said, naturally, that horror is entirely subjective, and what one person finds scary another will find boring, but all of the stories within Ashes don't actually seem to be trying to be scary, unless all of the writers have some sort of different definition of the word than I do.The problem with most of them is that they seem to lack any real point... there is rarely any sort of resolution, usually only a sort of token conflict, and most of them just kind of peter out with an ""oh well"" sort of vibe. One story, revolving around a pregnant woman abandoned on a farm, actually felt pointless, confusing, and downright silly to the point where I actually went back over it to see if I was missing something, or if a few pages had stuck together. Ashes makes for an entertaining read if you're looking to pass the time and relax for a few minutes, but there isn't much substance here, ghostly or otherwise.",neutral,book

3280,"I actually read the second book in this series, Primal Attraction, first.  Near the end of that book we are introduced to Kennedy and Tristan and I was intrigued.  I asked the author for a review copy of Primal Hunger immediately after reading Primal Attraction.  A weird way to read a series I know, but after reading Primal Attraction I was hooked and had to read Primal Hunger.Tristan Callaghan, a gargoyle shape-shifter, has a few problems.  Because of him, his brother Cian was cursed by a sorceress and trapped inside his stone form nearly a century ago. Tristan has dedicated his life to searching for a mystical dagger that may help break the curse and free his brother.  Nothing is more important and he has no time for distractions like the lovely Kennedy Beaumont.  Too bad his dual nature can't seem to come to terms with that.Kennedy works as bartender at Pendragon's, a bar that Tristan co-owns with his brother Cale.  She is human and has no idea that her sexy employer is actually a shape-shifting gargoyle and most of the patronage at the bar is also something other than human.  She just knows that mixing business with pleasure is never good and she needs her job more than a fling with the boss she can't get out of her head.When Kennedy's car breaks down on the side of the road one night after work, she's relieved when her boss happens upon her and offers her a ride home.  In an instant, all hell breaks loose and Tristan is drifting in and out of consciousness while Kennedy drives through the night running from who knows what, not knowing that she has just been thrust into a supernatural world she never knew existed.  Even worse an assassin has her in his sights and Tristan may be the one that holds the key to saving her life, but at the cost reversing his brothers curse.I'm actually glad I read these books out of order.  While I don't think someone reading Primal Hunger would be confused about the setting of the book and the history behind it, I do feel like I got a better understanding of the gargoyle curse, and the hunt for the daggers in Primal Attraction.  For me, the love story between Tristan and Kennedy shines in Primal Hunger and while the history of the shape-shifting gargoyles is interesting, it took more of a backseat to the romance.  Nothing wrong with that though, right?Tristan and Kennedy have denied their attraction to one another for some time, and I liked that I didn't have to read through two thirds of the book before they finally get together.  There's enough romantic tension between the two of them to make their rapid progression into a romantic relationship believable and although they don't jump into a full fledged physical relationship right away, they don't spend massive amounts of time fighting the feelings.  Granted, as a human, Kennedy has to go through the motions of understanding the new world she's been introduced to and she is not all that pleased to know she's been `claimed', she still seems to take it all in remarkably well.As paranormal heroes go, Tristan is gorgeous.  Alpha in all the right ways, willing to fight to the death for his mate, honorable to a fault and sexy as hell.  When in human form he still has that sexy cat thing going on.Kennedy is sassy, funny and a likeable heroine.  Although she's just become a pawn in the fight for an ancient relic sought after by dangerous immortals she manages to remain a sturdy character and seeks out a solution of her own at one point.  I enjoyed her no non-sense attitude and loved her sense of humor.Primal Hunger is another good paranormal romance by Sydney Somers.  It's a good start to a series with wonderfully erotic, romantic scenes, and enough action and adventure to keep the story moving along.",neutral,book

10156,"Taking Instruction is a look into the often hidden world of sexual BDSM and it does a pretty good job of telling the story. I did get a sense of Craig's and Jessica's personalities, but they weren't really well-developed. The characterizations seemed overwhelmed by the explicit sex scenes which composed most of the story. I did wonder where Craig got the money to have a custom-made dungeon built and do so much traveling on a professor's salary since I know from personal experience how poorly academics are paid. Overall, since I did find some of the scenes to be erotic, I would recommend this book.",neutral,book

6230,"At the request of his sister, Dylan is returning to the ranch he used to live at before the death of brother Simon the previous year. The ranch's owner, Wade, was Simon's partner, and has never been able to recover after Simon's Death. What ensues is a tale of both men burying their grief, and discovering the ability to love again.The story is well-written. The characters are nuanced enough to differentiate them from each other. The emotions feel real, and many scenes are touching and moving. Wade starts out as a shattered man. Simon was a huge part of his life, and Simon's absence is everywhere he looks. Being no stranger to the loss of a partner, I couldn't help but be moved to tears at points. Maybe the words struck home more easily to me because, upon experiencing loss, there will always be tender areas in your heart where pain is easily felt. Or maybe it was the writer was gifted at evoking those emotions. Regardless, there was bittersweet pain within the pages.Dylan's grief was deeply examined too. In Dylan's case, Simon was his cherished brother who died in his arms after they crashed their car. He moved from the Lazy G ranch because he not only could not face the absence of his brother in all the places he should be, but because he felt he should be the one to die, not Simon. He believed Wade would eventually tell him the same, and he could not bear that moment. To add into Dylan's grief is the guilt he felt because he always had a crush on Wade.The writing is pleasant and with good imagery. The characters do have a uniqueness to them which could have been fleshed out a little better, but they were still well-written. Interestingly, Simon is the most interesting character, and he's only examined briefly in a few memories. The only drawback I could find is that the heartfelt ending felt inevitable. The road it took to get there was interesting, but there were few and insignificant obstacles along the way. Still, there were very touching, romantic, sensual, erotic, funny, and heartfelt moments. Overall, a lovely diversion.",neutral,book

Prince Maximillian is 36 Years old and is a bachelor who has suffered through many of his mother's set ups and attempts to get him married off and churning out heirs to the throne.  Max has been pining after his assistant Tara, who is beautiful, capable and none the wiser he has the hots for her.  Tara also harbors romantic feelings for her boss but has managed to keep her feelings under lock and key. She believes the Prince could not possibly be serious about a commoner and she was destined for heartbreak when he eventually finds and marries his Princess.  Max realizes at a party when Tara is tipsy, that she is attracted to him and he sets about pursuing her and attempting to change her mind about their romance. The romance is more sweet than steamy and there were instances where I lost patience with Tara being so obtuse and clueless.  For someone who attended Harvard Business School a lot of interactions with Max's family went straight over her head.  She seemingly was unaware she was being vetted.

4635,"Having enjoyed my way through all of his major works, I am now filling in the remaining gaps in my reading of FP Wilson.  This one, ""Virgin"", was originally published in 1996 under the pseudonym, Mary Elizabeth Murphy. I have no clue why he used a nom de plume, except possibly that it is rather different from everything else that he had written to date.  Not horror, not SF, but your basic religious fantasy.  The eponymous Virgin is, indeed, Mary, the mother of Jesus, the one straight out of the standard Christian theology.This is nothing like Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code or any of his other novels.  Although the characters move around a lot, it's not anything like a treasure hunt, or, at least after the early sections of the novel, a mystery to be solved.  It's worth pointing out that it was published long before Brown sold millions of copies books dealing with supposed hidden truths of the Catholic Church. Anyway, the premise is interesting (as it is with all FP Wilson writings that I have seen), and to my knowledge is one of the first mainstream ""what if it were true"" novels dealing with the iconography of ChristianityAlthough published well after many of his blockbuster novels that made FPW a household name (at least among horror aficionados, Virgin has the feel of an ""early"" novel.  I'm not sure how to describe it more specifically than that.  It just didn't feel as solid as most of FPW's other works.  The characters of Father Dan and Sister Carrie are well enough developed FPW's usually are), and their early relationship is is believable.  Later developments between the two, well, less so.  Supporting characters were also three-dimensional with interesting backstories, particularly the mysterious Israeli agent who seems to have a special agenda with respect to the relic.For me the biggest disappointment in this novel was the ending.  After a more than reasonable build-up, the last 20% of the novel, especially the literal deus ex machina ending just left me feeling cheated.  As if FPW had jumped the proverbial (pun intended) shark.  I just didn't find the sequence of events believable or compelling or even logical (if anything based in religious mythology can be said to be logical).  The ending felt rushed, and cheap compared to the set-up, and to the endings to the dozens of other FP Wilson novels that I've read.Perhaps it's in part because I'm not a ""true believer"", and have always had trouble understanding how so many so easily accept the whole Christian mythos when it seems so full of logical flaws and impossibilities.  Anyway, this one didn't do it for me.  It was OK, but not nearly in the same league as the Repairman Jack or Adversary Cycle series, or many of his other parts of the Secret History of the World (e.g., Black Wind, published in 1988, being a prime example of FP Wilson at his best.)J.M.

9534,I love this authors work and have left a number of great reviews for her in the past but I just couldn't do it for this one. I do have to give her props for doing a piece set in a different era.The story was basically one quick sex scene that just didn't have the heat I expect to read from this author. The characters were flat for me and I found myself having a hard time staying interested in it.I would recommend skipping the 5 minutes it takes to read this and buy one of her other works.

9840,"""A Hard Man is Good to Find"" takes match-making to a new extreme.  Knowing that her two closest friends were perfect for one another - if they would stop hating each other long enough to figure it out - Callie left her house to both of them under the condition that they live in it together for one year.  After the year was up, they could either sell it and split the proceeds or, as she had hoped, live there together having ""wild monkey sex in every room of the house at least once a day.""  Kelsey and Clint had not expected this to say the least when they attended the reading of the will of their recently departed very close friend.Kelsey is an independent woman who becomes enraged just about every time she is near Clint Duncan, although she is not oblivious to the fact that her nipples are almost always erect in his presence as well.  She is simultaneously infuriated and completely turned on by him.  Clint's reaction to Kelsey, both physically and emotionally, is pretty much the same.  The reader is treated to a perhaps predictable tale where the two protagonists slowly begin to overlook their irritation and expose their infatuation for one another.One thing that I really liked about this book is that from the beginning, it was no secret that Kelsey is in fact a spankophile.  She references spanking in the first few pages and quickly delves into a spanky daydream featuring her nemesis, Clint, himself.I like the majority of Carolyn Faulkner's spanking fiction.  She writes very well and draws the reader in.  Her books seem to follow the typical romance novel template: ordinary woman meets tall hunk and initially HATES him - but eventually starts to see his finer qualities.  They eventually have a whirl wind romance and declare complete and total devotion to one another.  The only difference is that Carolyn's template includes a session over the knee of the tall hunk every chapter or so (which I have to say is a great twist on the typical romance novel).  I am a huge fan of Carolyn Faulkner as I love occasionally getting lost in a tale of love and spanking.  If you are looking to spend an afternoon like this, then I would definitely recommend you pick up a copy of ""A Hard Man is Good to Find.""Katerina of BottomsUpBookReview",neutral,book

My main objection is the author's grammar and word usage.  This is not everyone's strong point, so having a skilled editor to check your book over is a must if you want to write.  This author has a hard time with possessives--both singular and plural, seems unsure of the difference between ""it's"" and ""its"" and repeatedly uses the phrase ""use to"" as in, ""They weren't use to powdered milk.""  It's supposed to be ""used to"".  These seem like small quibbles, but many people judge writing both by content and by skill with spelling and grammar.

Characters were interesting but except for the main female they lacked significant depth.  The genesis of Malcolm introduces the idea of visitors from another planet but again it was not so interesting that I will be inclined to look for the second book.  In fact I read Uprising a few months ago and had to read it again before removing it from my kindle to be sure that I hadn't accidentally missed reading it.

3021,"In ""Tabloid Star"", which is a very good tale, by the way, we got to witness the romance of Josh and Ryan. Ryan an up-and-coming mega action film star, and Josh a beefy burly bartender at a hot local club. By the end, the two men committed to each other as a couple. In this tale, the story picks up with their wedding.The story is not as compelling as Tabloid Star, but that's not really a problem. You see, the drama was laid out in Tabloid Star, and it's there that the traditional romance unveils. This shorter tale is for fans of the original story who want to see what life has in store for our two heroes. There love is not in question, so there's no conflict there. If anything, this story serves as a sort of extended epilogue. It toggles back and forth between the wedding itself and the events leading up to it after Tabloid Star.It's short, it's sweet, and it's priced accordingly. It lacks the conflict and drama of a romance story because, well, it's not. But it still easily fulfills its original intent of closing out the original tale and letting fans of those two characters have a taste of them again. Tabloid Star was the cake, and With This Ring is the scoop of ice cream on the side.",neutral,book

6226,"Let me first say that I enjoy Brenda Jackson's character development. Each Westmoreland male is interesting and unique. The heroines are all professional, intelligent, ""virgins"". Surprisingly each heroine is a virgin over the age of 25 with the exception of Madison who had one prior sexual experience. In my opinion it is not realistic of your average woman over 25 years of age to be a virgin (while ideal and sweet not realistic). But I still say that Brenda Jackson's characters are wonderful. In the family of the Westmoreland's it is believed that they will all marry a person with whom they fall in love with at first sight. Love at first sight was believable with brothers Dare and Storm. Their love interests were women they had known for years. I did not buy the ""love at first sight"" theme between Delaney Westmoreland and Prince Jamal nor Stone and Madison. Again, romantic idea but unbelievable. The other three I bought it and loved it.I most enjoyed A Little Dare, it was my favorite of the first 5 books. Thorn Westmoreland is my favorite character from the series. I enjoyed his story as well. Stone Cold Surrender and Riding the Storm are the reasons I'm giving this review 3.5 stars. I thought the heroines were a bit extreme.  Madison tracking her 50 year old mom in the mountains of Montana and Jayla yet in her 20's choosing to be artificially inseminated because she's lonely. I thought that was extremely selfish. However each story has a satisfying end. Stone Cold Surrender has the redeeming aspect of Corey and Abby finding each other after so many years. I really enjoyed their part of the book. Their story touched my heart. I'm looking forward to reading the stories of the additional Westmoreland family members who were introduced.",neutral,book

With almost no advertisements, you just get the articles and pictures in a very concise and easy to read format.

With it being in my Kindle am able to have it with me, whenever I'm looking for something to read.  Perfect for the commute and for unexpected waits.My only complaint is a small one.  In the ""Page One"" section of the paper, it has several ""What's News"" blurbs, after the first couple articles.  While this is useful on the print version, it is annoying and distracting on the Kindle.  You get the first paragraph of articles deep in the paper, with a link to get to them.  Since the menu page already has links to every single article in the paper, this is detracting, disrupts the flow of reading the paper, and is pointless.  I really wish that they would get rid of these ""article teaser links"", but in the mean time, I'll just have to get used to skipping them.Overall, I really love the WSJ on my Kindle.

Either the author was in too big a hurry to get it out to properly proof it, or his knowledge of language usage is really lacking.Numerous instances of ""you're"" when it should have been ""your"", ""there"" instead of ""their"", ""where"" instead of ""were"", ""here"" instead of ""hear"", plus several more. Coming across these klinkers in the story are like skating along and suddenly hitting a rock.Spell check wouldn't have caught any of these things; they were spelled correctly, just used incorrectly.

9865,"Alexandra Riley has no idea about her heritage. Has no idea her father's a werewolf until the day she becomes hunted. That's the day Joshua Striker shows up in her father's garage.Being a Striker is more than just a name. Amongst the Wolf Creek pack, they are judge, jury, and executioner when need be. His job now is to take Alex back to North Carolina where she'll be safe from males on the hunt for a mate, bounty hunters and werewolves who think mixed breeds like Alex should be put down.The premise sounded almost breathtaking for a paranormal fan like me, but I had a heck of a time getting into this one. The story began interesting enough, but I found it hard to believe Joshua was as feared as claimed, like what I was told clashed with what I was being shown. That was only one example. There were a few more awkward spots of inconsistency with the characters and their personality.The action scenes were the best. I also enjoyed the secondary characters, but the romance scenes fell flat for me. I simply wasn't feeling it.",neutral,book

547,"I really do enjoy Troy Denning's work, I want everyone who reads this review to know this.  I loved Star by Star and I very much enjoyed Tattooine Ghost.  This book ""A Forest Apart"" wasn't on par with his other works.  It wasn't without it's charm, but it had things in it that I didn't like.The story itself is pretty simple.  It's a coming of age story for Chewbacca's son, and instead of coming of age on Kashyyyk, he is growing up on Coruscant.  It's not horrible, and we find out that Lumpy is an avid gamer and enjoys playing video games and that he idolizes his father.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***First of all, why is Han Solo on the cover?  He's not even IN this story other than a few mentions of his name.  Why not have Chewbacca and Lumpy instead of Han and Chewie?  Also, I HATE books where Chewbacca's grunts and growls are translated.  Like in the Black Fleet Trilogy, he had his speech translated and it was just stupid.  I feel that he works much better as a strong silent type who speaks through his actions rather than his words.  I mean imagine in characters like Jason Vorhees, Michael Meyers, Silent Bob, or Sphynx (from Gone in 60 Seconds), all just started having lengthy conversations throughout their movies?  They lose some of what makes those characters awesome.  Sometimes an author can say very much by having a character say very little.My only other problem with the book is when Chewie and Malla have the droid ""IT"" in their blaster sights, his back is to them and he doesn't see them.  Why don't they just shoot him?  Instead they send Lumpy out as a ""distraction.""  Yet he doesn't really do anything worth mentioning to distract IT and his minions.  He walks out on the observation deck where they are hiding, opens the window and drops down to the level where IT and his minions are loading nerve gas onto transport ships.  I mean that's not much of a distraction, besides the point of a distraction is to get someone's attention away from one spot so you can do something while they are not looking.  Well, IT wasn't looking in your direction to begin with, so why bother?  They could have just taken up positions on the observation deck and shot him.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Okay so this story wasn't really bad other than a few minor details I didn't like.  I did like seeing that even in a galaxy far far away that we have sons who want to be like their fathers and get into trouble when they do rebellious things.

3720,"Sydney Somer's Primal Hunger is one of those stories that disappoint me, not for what it is, but for what it could be and yet isn't. Full of interesting mythos, a spunky heroine with a backbone, and an Alpha male to drool for, the building blocks exist to make this title a really fantastic paranormal romance. Unfortunately, the combination of the length of the story (far closer to novella than mass market paperback) and the focus on the sexual relationship between the two main characters, Kennedy and Tristan, kept this book from truly blossoming into a fully satisfying read for me. And that's a shame, because there really was a lot to like about Somer's writing style and creativity here.Ultimately, there just wasn't enough story to raise my appreciation for the book higher than three stars. I'm a huge fan of erotic fiction. I actually prefer my books with healthy, adult, explicit sex scenes that help define and enhance the romantic pairing between couples in paranormal romances, and I'm very open minded about sex in general. Flowery euphemisms and delicate wording are a turnoff - in life and in books. That being said, however, my preference is that the story comes first and the sex scenes be a part of that story, not the whole of the story. In Primal Hunger, the sex (while steamy, hot, and very erotic) was the center of the story and the plot and mythos about the gargoyles, wraiths, Avalon, King Arthur, Fae, as well as the development of the emotional side of Kennedy and Tristan's relationship, were more like random leaves being tossed around in the cyclone of the sexual relationship. That was such a shame, because I love gargoyles and wish there were more paranormal romances that featured them, and Arthurian novels have always been an interest of mine. By the end, I basically enjoyed Primal Hunger for what it is, but felt disappointed by all the missed opportunities to raise the bar. Still, I've got the  second in the Pendragon Gargoyles series, Primal Attraction, so I'll be giving the series at least one more go.",neutral,book

But there's also Costa Rican jail, armed mercenaries, falls down jungle cliffs, nights spent out in the jungle by someone who would be more likely to be on the ""Real Housewives"" series - and a jarring disconnect as a love story rekindles and grows, and a character finds ""herself.""  It was kind of fun until the lectures and the navel gazing revelations and the absolute crazy disconnect of glossing over what started it all.  That was odd and really took away from the book, as did the focus on bees when I'd so much rather have been reading about the aromatherapy healing cures found in the rainforest - odd that that was given very little importance compared with the ""man's"" work!  Would have been dissapointed if it hadn't been free.  I was also equally confused about the message sent to women by the author, as the heroine found her personal power she also found a lot more self blame and a lot less justifiable blame.

4085,"Well where should I start ..... I finished reading Board Resolution and the wonder that someone could write such a combination of a nebulous teenage wet dream and the fantasies of every inadequate woman hater was overwhelming.The premise that a woman who was as powerful and masterful in a male dominated world of high finance could be reduced to some trembling and sexually desperate slave was such a stretch for my human mind to begin with that I could hardly believe that the author would push me even farther into fantasy land with the thought that a bit of date rape combined with a most creative gang-bang which would be ""just what she needed"" just pushed me over the edge of any possibility to see this as anything more than literary porn written to appeal to men with inadequate equipment and women with severe mental problems.I should pause for a moment to make sure you understand that I am not a fan of erotica (much less BDSM). The reason has nothing to do with the sex but much to do with the fact that almost all of it (with a few notable exceptions) is poorly written, has little if anything resembling a plot outside of writing about sex in various incarnations and generally reduces the characters to little more than what can be done in the erogenous areas between ones legs. The writings of Larissa Ione are more to my speed in this area since she weaves her erotic scenes into an overall plot that while including sex in various forms have an end game that includes more than an orgasm.Back to the story at hand, our dual personality heroine Savannah, who apparently can run a billion dollar corporation but has the need to be date raped and treated like a piece of meat by Matthew Lord Kensington (ya gotta love that name) and brought to the pinnacle of self awareness by a gang-bang of sorts with his buddies. I know what you are thinking, ""What a fantastic love story"" &lt; sarcasm/off> but somewhere along the way anything resembling reality checked out and it might as well have been Star Trek porn (and the actions of this version of ""Scotty the engineer"" are about as impossible as getting that extra bit of warp drive).The HEA of this makes my head spin since I would have tasered his ass on about page 11 and end of story or if I let things play out in this nightmarish scenario, the next step should have been Savannah getting a sexy 40 caliber Glock and polishing these boys off this earth. Apparently, my naivety in the world of BDSM did not realize the proper reaction is to be grateful to the rapists and fall madly in love with one of them. Such is this story and since I don't have a number smaller than the national debt to measure the incredulity of this story all I can say is that it does have a ""train wreck"" appeal but any lasting compulsion to read it again would have me wondering if my secret desire is to become a serial rapist.",neutral,book

I agree with Segwick when he says James is confident about sex - in general that's what comes off in Lanyon's books I've read so far - the scenes are part of the story, an extension of the character and the plot - not an extra thrown in to qualify for erotic. I did have a bit of a hard time getting into this one. Of course the parallel's to Christmas Carol are here and welcomed.",neutral,book

3405,"Amy Parker had only room for one love in her life, and that was work.  She was a junior partner at the law firm she worked for, but her goal was to make senior partner by the end of the year.  Always known for iron control in all situations, everyone would be so surprised to find out the secret longing she harbored for her subordinate Justin Garrett.  They were in Maui to get a deal hammered out before Christmas.  Little did Amy realize, but Justin knew about her innermost fantasies as he had inadvertently opened her personal email, and read all about them in her conversations with her best friend Gloria.  He planned to stake his claim to her this trip, and be the master of her body from now on.  Amy was a different person in Hawaii.  She was relaxed and free.  Justin liked this Amy, but he knew also the problems they were facing, and the roadblocks she would throw in their path.  They were competitive colleagues, and he was younger than she was.  He didn't care about any of it, but knew that Amy would be over thinking this to death.  Justin decided he would be the one to give Amy the life she deserved, as well as the best Christmas present he, and their client Mitch Magruder could possibly give her.This was a very sensual and sexy Christmas short story.  Justin is a no nonsense laid back kind of guy while Amy is the ice queen, and always in complete control.  He shakes her up, and makes her want things she thought she could never have.",neutral,book

10196,"In a nutshell, if you liked City of Rogues, you'll likely enjoy this as well.  Kron Darkbow is on the road with Adara, master swordswoman, and Randall, a nice young man who happens to be the son of a depraved, evil super-wizard.  They're hunted by the villains they failed to finish off in City of Rogues, stalked by war demons sent by the villain they're after in the next book, and they're facing all sorts of new villains all along the road.The same strengths from City of Rogues are in place in Road to Wrath.  There is non-stop action, a bit of struggle with moral dilemmas, a dark theme of vengeance and justice, and then even more action.The same weaknesses are present as well.  Some of the writing is clumsy, and there are some irritating typos.  None of it is very deep, in characterization or world-building.  However, the power of the storytelling makes the book irresistible.",neutral,book
7955,"When I read the preview of this book I thought it was going to be really good, so I gave it a chance.It's about Alex are girl who lives with her father learning one day she is a half werewolf, and her father is a full blooded werewolf who kept this secret from her to protect her all her life. Now since she is coming in ""heat"" she needs a mate, and there are tons of single male werewolves out to find her to force her to be their mate.The story line seemed pretty interesting at first, but then it just kind of fizzeled out after the first few chapters. I really liked Alex, she had a wonderful personality and I saw her as a very strong women. But she was the only thing I really enjoyed about this book.Everything else just fell flat for me.

3700,"'Forbidden Desires' is book two in Stormy Glenn's Tri-Omega Mates series and it continues the sexy fun of the small pack filled with gay men. Once again, I was drawn into this small family and into their lives and loves.Ryland was beaten almost to death by his birth pack for being small and weak and then they left him to die. Unbeknownst to them and his new pack, Ryland is a Tri-Omega which means when he gets claimed by both of his mates he'll be able to shift and he will come into his powers. From the moment Gregory rescues him, Ryland knows they're mates, he's just been waiting patiently to be claimed.Gregory has done everything possible for six years to not claim Ryland. He's been waiting for him to come of age and be ready. So, when his Alpha's mate, Leyland, allows Gregory to see into Ry's heart and he realizes how much Ry is ready to be claimed and be his mate, Gregory wastes no time and claims him. Unfortunately, Gregory didn't listen when Leyland told him that Ry is &#34;just like&#34; Leyland, meaning he's a Tri-Omega and will have two mates. So now that Gregory has claimed him, they have a limited amount of time to locate Ry's other mate or he could die.Enter Viktor, Beta to another pack that Gregory and Ryland meet while on vacation. Viktor isn't so sure about this whole Tri-Omega thing and he's positive he doesn't want to have to share his mate. That's part of what makes this book so very different from the first story. Here there's literally three people who have to acclimate to each other on an intimate level instead of being lovers for awhile already.I liked this story as it was fairly unique. Ryland ends up with some very interesting powers and with the two men he loves. There is a little drama, but nothing earth shattering. If you like shifter stories, multiple men, and hot, smexy fun, then this is a good read and a good series for you.",neutral,book

7694,"I liked this story okay; there was just something missing in it for me personally.I did love this hero. Will's an alpha-nerd and a virgin; you definitely don't see this everyday! I loved how he is socially awkward, taciturn, and even a little obsessive and fixated on the heroine. I do think the author missed a great opportunity to make the book more about this intense yet vulnerable man's emotional, childhood scar.I think the heroine's sexual assualt was an intrusive plot device for discussing the hero's own tragic episode. It's almost as if the stalker co-worker is thrown in to force that conversation about Will's past, and that wasn't really needed, in my opinion. I would much rather there had been some sort of issue develop between the H/h over his past and not over the heroine's withdrawal from him as she recovers from her own attack. The focus was more on the heroine's current issues and needs, and this made Will's emotional damage seem like an afterthought.I felt for the heroine after her attack, but for some reason I was much more sympathetic to Will and his history. How can you not feel for a hero who cries in the shower after the heroine had done something inadvertently which reminded him of his own bad experience? He's a strong yet needy character, and I just wish that had been more the focus.All in all, this was not a bad story. Don't want you to think that it was, but I just wanted something more for Will, something special for him. He finally gets the girl of his dreams, his first girlfriend ever, his first kiss, his first lover, and the very trauma that has made him wait for all this is confined to one conversation at the very end of the book. So much more could have been done with that. And that left me disappointed in it and maybe a little sad for this special hero.",neutral,book

11942,"Aptly titled, ""Second Chance Romance"" follows high school and college sweethearts Kip Turner and Mandy Green, who after 11 years still carry a torch for each other. With both of them now 30 years old, with Kip a successful professional hockey player who plays for the NHL while Mandy is a school teacher and single mom, they reconnect through Facebook and find themselves searching for their happily-ever-after.Great premise for a beautiful love story. Unfortunately, the telling was flat and the characters remained two-dimensional until the end. And though this book is classified erotica, and I would rate this M for mature audience only because of sex and language use, classifying this erotica is using the term loosely.Erotica as a genre already has a lot of detractors. And of course, those who read erotica already knows that it can go either way, one extreme is that it is outright porn, while the other end of the spectrum is that erotica is a beautiful story wherein sex scenes are part of the telling and it will not be complete without it. Case in point, ""In the Realm of the Senses"", a 1976 Franco-Japanese romantic drama film directed by Nagisa Oshima, is perhaps one of the best examples of the erotica genre.""Second Chance Romance"" has all the elements of the latter side of the spectrum of the genre. An exciting hero who is not just good looking but very athletic; a painfully shy heroine who blossomed as she gained more confidence as the love story proceeds. Unfortunately, the book fell short on everything about storytelling.And that is the reason why I am really disappointed that the story and the characters remained flat. There really was no climax to speak of; the struggles were minimal and though we know that Kip and Mandy deserve their HEA, the telling of how they got there left a lot to be desired.So, why the two star rating instead of one? Just like the lesson of the book, everyone deserves a second chance. And I hope that the author takes this as a constructive criticism and that she continues to write as she improves on her craft.",neutral,book

7488,"I think I might have enjoyed this a bit more than some of the other reviewers, but it wasn't anything new or impressive. It read a little more like a novella than a full on novel as there were parts that seemed thrown together and pieces skimmed over.If you are looking for a little paranormal romance that is solid and reliable, then this is for you. The characters weren't fully developed, but you got the general idea who they were. Part of this was the need to set up a bit of a backdrop for future stories, I think. I found Ms. Rogers depiction of pack rules to be interesting and LOVED the touch that the heroine was a strong wolf, but because of her circumstances didn't know what the heck was going on.It was light, funny and romantic. There were one or two plot points that left our characters making silly decisions and that was a bit annoying.

I liked the main male character, an Oregon professorial candidate specializing in the flora and fauna of Oregon. What was most interesting, though, was the concept of a race from the stars who are intelligent, gentle, and devoted to one another. Very nice. I know some were frustrated by the fact that Kent took to Povre so easily. Hey, get a grip, people! It is a story - a very sweet story of the most unusual kind of 'cross-racial' relationship. Extremely cross-racial, as in cross-species. But how is that any more questionable than the whole ""woman meets vampire/werewolf/demon/angel"" thing that is so popular these days? I love those, too! The idea that a human botanist/biologist could find an endangered alien and not want to cut her up? Pretty cool concept.

I was very happy to find out that it is not.The story is about a campground of mostly pre-teens, who end up being without any adult supervision after a fog, of unknown but deadly variety, cuts them off from most of the world.The only adult that was left at the campground was a 20 year old counselor, who seems to withdraw into herself and out of the issues that are coming up.A small group of kids end up taking charge of the group. And they do very well at it. The leader, nicknamed Chief, is Mike, a 13 year old teen. Nobody else seems to even have any ideas of what to do, other than himself and a few of their friends.This book takes place over a time period of about 3 years. Mike is 13 when it starts and is one week shy of 16 when it ends.I didn't have much of a problem with some of the age differences. One of the couples was a 17 year old teen and a early to mid 20's woman. I didn't find that at all unusual, or upsetting. I thought that the remarkable strength, of 20 year old man who is sexually targeted by a 14 year girl, was kind of neat.It does need some editing.

10418,"I got this because I like collaborated short stories. Alot of times when two good writers put their heads together, the results turn out well. This is the case with this short story. The writers take an age old lesson and turn it into a good read. It begins with, as they call it, Crazy #1 who is picking up a hitchhiker and from there it gets graphic and a little much for my taste. Then it cuts to Nutcase #2 who is hitchhiking. They inevitably get together and the results are suspenseful. The ending I felt was well deserved on both accounts.I also watched the video of the two authors on how they decided to break this short story up and the idea was cool. One wrote their side for scenario 1 and the other did scenario 2 without talking with each other about how tier side was going. Then, when it came for them to bring the two pieces together, they made them fit perfectly.

680,"Beautiful Demons is the second book by Sarra Cannon I have read. I didn't love the first one, The Trouble With Goodbye, but I realized I already had this book, and in some reviews for TTWG the reviewers stated they liked this series much better, so I thought I would give it a try. While I did like it better than the first book, it still wasn't amazing. I will, however, read the second book once I get through some of my library books.Beautiful Demons starts off with Harper being sent to another foster home. This is her last chance. She knows there is something different about her, but she tries to keep that secret for good reason. She accidentally started a fire when she was younger, when she gets mad things move by themselves, just things she doesn't know how to deal with. Shadowford Home is a strange place, but she is determined to make it work.Her first day of school she sees them - the cheerleaders. She had run into the star quarterback when school shopping, but once Drake found out where she lived he couldn't get away fast enough. The whole school has an obsession with the cheerleaders. They all want to be them. They are the most beautiful people in school, and date the cutest guys. Harper makes enemies pretty quick with the queen bee, but tries to stay out of trouble. She doesn't understand all the hype with them. Sure they are pretty, but so what? She also has some strange things happen to her in her first few weeks. She faints when she walks by the demon statue on her first day! She has strange dreams and people act odd. She knows something is up with the town.Harper does become friends with one of the girls she lives with, and has a huge crush on the guy who lives behind their house (the one caretakers son), Jackson. There is the instant connection with Harper and Jackson and he is trying to keep her safe. She wants to know what is going on in the town, but Jackson cannot tell her. He does his best though.Now up until this point in the book I was really enjoying it. Then one night Harper has a weird dream, is sick for a week, and when she wakes up she cannot remember what has recently happened. She can only remember a little bit of her time at Shadowford Home. The cheerleaders starts being nice to her and trying to be her friends, and Drake starts talking to her like he wants to date her. Harper, after only like 2 minutes of what is going on, is suddenly drawn into their crowd. I didn't get it. Well I got why she was, but it didn't actually seem like she was different. The writing didn't make her seem like she would suddenly want to be a cheerleader, when before she was scoffing at them. I wish it would have been more like she changed, or something made her change, to make her just forgive Drake and be all yes! This is what I want. I just didn't see it. You could still keep the moments where she thinks something is not quite right, but I didn't see her actually changing enough, or being lonely enough and wanting to fit in any way possible, for her to be trying out for the cheerleaders.Then you don't really find out what is going on in the town at all in this book. It is a pretty short book, and you don't really learn much. Hopefully some of the secrets will be revealed in the next book. It wasn't horrible, but the second half was kind of a let down. I just wish it would have been more obvious that Harper changed, instead of having her be basically the same but not.

It started out with one and a couple more after that, but the book has more than that kind of action going on, which was good since I thought I accidentally got an erotica during the first scene.This had a nice telling of vampires, and I liked Twyla's character, though I'm not 100% sure I'm saying her name right. I liked Nikos, too--I'm a fan of Greek history. I won't give anything away, but I got confused at Twyla's revelation about Nikos (I mean, he was Spartan and had been in many wars during his two and a half thousand year life). There was a few confusing descriptions that either I had to re-read to get or just plainly didn't get. However, there was quite a few I did like. Hughes had a nice, refreshing writing style that sounded like how a person would talk, given that's because it's taken from Twyla's perspective.Overall, I liked this book, but I'm not sure if I want to read more or not. I might recommend this to some but maybe not all my friends.",neutral,book

113,"I read this one first, when it is actually #2 in the series.  I loved it!  Rachel Myers is a character that I really like.  She took her time to decide that she wasn't ready to commit to marriage to her beau in Arizona and decided to give up a good job that she'd held for 16 years and move back to where her roots are in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina.  I also chose this book because I've been all through the Blue Ridge Parkway many times and it brought back nice memories of such beauty.Once Rachel gets about halfway settled in, her friend Isaac comes over to ask a favor of her.  A friend of his died by falling over a cliff to his death below, but police have ruled it either suicide or an accident, but Isaac knows in his heart it was neither.  He wants Rachel to do her own little investigation of this incident.  In between getting her house ready, her gardens done with the help of a landscaper, buying a new car, and meetings for her work, she manages to interview a lot of people who could be connected to Isaac's friend's death.  Some of them certainly have good motives, or at least it seems that way.One of the things I loved best about this book is the gardening and the discussions of the different kinds of flowers and plants that Rachel has.  I could just smell the lemon verbena (which is so hard to control!) and was amazed at the different kinds of hosta. Rachel is someone I could easily be friends with, and she would make a great conversationalist and just an all around fun friend.  There is humor in the book, tension, suspense and romance.  Her new suitor hopefully works out, as well as her new job.I intend to download as many as I can of these mysteries.  With cozy mysteries like this one, there is always something new to learn.  Cozy and mystery fans in general, go for it!",neutral,book

5816,"I've enjoyed this blog a lot on my Kindle. It has a really nice mix of stuff - how better to say, it's kind of interesting musings about all kinds of things, not just books or technology.The postings are very well written, as we'd expect from Amazon. The entries are about the right length. And they are enjoyable to read. I am addicted to Engadget, so I pretty much see tech events as they happen in almost real time. Amazon's reporting on those events is only about 24 hours behind, or just barely behind.There's a couple of strange things that just don't work so well. The formatting is odd at best. There's a lot of hyperlinks in the blog. Unfortunately on a Kindle they get underlined with a little character behing them and some spaces - so it's super strange to read with these annoying little characters. Of course you can open up the hyperlink by clicking, but it's kind of a pain.Images don't always work the best. They are OK, but sometimes there's more pictures that are important.Then there's video posted occaisonally, well that sure doens't work at all.Now the biggest complaint. If you happen to not read this blog for about 2 days, the old postings disappear. And there's no way to go reload them. So if on Thursday, I've forgetten to or not bothered to read Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday postings - most certainly there will be no Monday material.

Nothing real, anyway. I was terribly dissapointed. I think there is such potential here for something nifty but I found it was a real let down. Even the sex. Maybe most especially the sex. It was so bad that I kept muttering to myself ""good grief, when is the sex going to END???"". And mind you, I appreciate a good shag to go along with a plot but this just didnt cut the mustard.My over all opinion is if you are desperate and want something that is all sex with vampires but no real BITE, then take a peek.

4272,"Wonderful book. All of Kallysten's work that I have read as of yet as been wonderful.This one took me a bit to jump in, and get the bearing and surroundings for some reason. I had a cold for a bit, so maybe it was just that.Marc and Blake are vampires. Marc being the Master and Blake being his Childe. The setting is in the future when Pacts are no longer formed or mean much of anything. (Pacts are where vampires keep humans safe and in exchange they give vampires blood.)(To learn more about Pacts see Kallysten's series titled The Pact) Vampires used to keep humans safe from the demons that roam the earth. There seem to be more and more demons roaming, this is caused by rips in the reality. Marc and Blake are looking for the rip when they come across some human fighters who are in need of assistance. Of course humans nowadays aren't as trusting and fear that these 2 vampires might be working with the demons. so it takes some time before a little bit of trust is formed.Amongst the group of fighters is Kate, who both Marc and Blake find attractive and desire. Kate is slow to realize it, but she too has an attraction to not just one of them but both of them. Although there is ground work set for more with these 3, there isn't much in this book. (can't wait for the next one and the one after that, as it will be about these three, but back to this one first.) They fight together and the start to trust one another, and slowly build more of a foundation.The vampires and the humans main goal becomes to find the rip and get it sealed, so they move on to a new town and start once more. Slowly making earth a safe place once again. There is hurt, and some betrayal, and enough lust to make you want more. Once the story gets going, its hard to put down, it just seems to fly by and before you know it its over and your wanting the next book so you can continue on with their journey and see what more is to come.",neutral,book

The three make for amazing chemistry and witty banter.  From first meeting there is a spark and although Kate is put off by Blake's cocky attitude she's extremely intrigued by Marc and his relationship with Blake.  Kate has lived as a soldier for quite some time, she's bonded as a warrior with her fellow teammates, Marc and Blake bring the woman back out in her.

Of all the reasons why a Dark Angel is called to dole out vengeance, enabling a woman to get even with a cheating ex-boyfriend doesn't seem quite important enough.  But maybe that's just me.No real character development.  She's supposed to be a powerful Witch in her own right, so why should she need an Angel to help her get even with her Ex?  He's an Angel who is bored sitting around the Underworld waiting for the Devil to give him an assignment.  So, of course, he's thrilled when a sad Witch needs his help.  And what does he do to to give her the revenge that she craves?  He beats the guy up.  Yep, I'm not kidding.No real world building.

If it's that easy to get your hands on a sexy winged hunk,  there should have been a lot of happy women in that world.So the Witch and the Dark Angel end up falling in love and having lots of sex.

8721,"As an avid lover of fairytales revamped for adults, I literally devoured ""Mrs. Beast"" in one sitting. I began reading it around 10p.m. and I stayed up until about 2 a.m. It was that good. I loved how Elora had her finger in every fairytale ""pie"" and her interactions with her poor, mistreated mutt.The sequel starts out strong, but as soon as the protagonist, Rune (the daughter of Beauty and the Beast) goes on a quest to find the Hedgehog turned Prince that she is infatuated with, the story rapidly begins to lose steam. I think the problem is Ms. Ditchoff used and elaborated on the backstory of so many better known, more interesting fairytale characters all the well known, more interesting fairytale heroines in her first book, leaving her to really scrape for more to use in this one and the characters are, for lack of a better word, lame and completely one-dimensional. Or perhaps she was rushed when she wrote the sequel and was not able to take the same amount of time and care she put into the first to really expand upon her characters.I found myself unable to connect or really care about Rune or all the characters in the story the way I did when I read Mrs. Beast. Plus, the characters who share their tales are so unfamilar to me, that I felt kind of lost and my interest wanned.For example, Rune meets the Bog King's daughter who takes FOREVER to tell her boring story which could have been summed up in a paragraph. Basically this is her backstory: Mom is raped by the Bog King, daughter is born and turns into a 80lb frog each night(sounds like Fiona from Shrek...). Priest comes to village, then Bog daughter escapes to Egypt with Mom, turns back into a princess, then goes to Heaven with the Priest, returns to earth and finds that 100 years have passed, so now she is a bolt of lightening for all eternity that works for Elora. Um...yeah...okay...Elora is a lot more subdued in the story and her interactions with her mutt don't sizzle with the same humor and irony. I forced myself to continue reading, but it was unenjoyable and a big let down.Because of the strength of Mrs. Beast, I would be willing to give a third book by Ms. Ditchoff a try, but if it dissapoints me as much as Princess Beast, then I won't be purchasing anymore.",neutral,book

403,"This was damn near everything that I needed it to be. The problem was that it was too short. Beg for It had everything it needed to be a full length novel, if the author were interested in investing a little more time on plot development. A huge chunk of the e-book is all sex, hot sex, but all sex. Still, I thought Malone did a good job of incorporating plenty of heart. Because of the length the novel felt a little rushed in throwing our hero and heroine together. They've got plenty of back history but we don't really get to experience too much of it because of the novella's brevity.Mya Taylor is in love with her best friend, Milo Hamilton. A hastily made bet on who will get the new account at the ad agency they work for leads to a long, hot weekend during which they admit to wanting more than to be just best buddies. Only, of course, a random willowy, blonde shows up at the door and our short, dark, curvy heroine gets the wrong idea and goes home to pout. What little is left of the novella is spent getting these too wacky kids back together (which turns out to be surprisingly painless).Malone is a strong writer, and unlike much of the other offerings in this category that I've read of late, this was a well-written, solidly edited short. There were some things that I didn't care for, like some of the hero's more cave man actions and the heroine's limp pining, but overall it was a good read. The other thing that I didn't like was the oblique to non-existent references to our heroine's ethnicity. She's described as having loads of curls and with skin from caramel to cinnamon. Now, there's a lot of distance between caramel and cinnamon. I, for one, like the cinnamon reference better. The cover is the only absolute description of the heroine as African-American.I've been reading a lot of self-published Amazon novellas with interracial couples at the heart. Most of them are throw always, but the ones that I really do like highlight the differences between the couples. Sadly, for all that it's better written than most of them, Malone's story lacks that component.",neutral,book

The grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors might have been caused by the conversion process, so I did my best to ignore them and am only mentioning them so future readers can be prepared.

1480,"I found this vaguely depressing. If you don't mind uncomfortable settings (war) and circumstances (widowhood, capture & pursuit by the enemy) and relationships that seem destined to go nowhere (regrettable class barriers), then you might enjoy this. It started off nicely, but got steadily gloomier. At about 70%, I gave it up altogether - while it might have had a satisfying ending, by that point I was too discouraged to care.Other reviewers have commented on the similarities to Carla Kelly, but I was disappointed to find the wartime setting was the only thing the novels shared. I absolutely loved Carla Kelly's Marrying the Captain, Royal Marine and Surgeon series. They were gritty portrayals of war as secondary to the romance - yet the romances were heart-warming, uplifting and somehow full of hope. I don't mind angst and tension, but I must feel hopeful. I read for pleasure and this book just struck me as too gloomy. The hero and heroine seemed too willing to accept that they had no future together. Their relationship always focused on imminent separation, so they didn't fully enjoy the present.Just wasn't the book for me, I'm sorry to say. I'm sorry because I would have loved to have found another author who can offer such heartwarming stories as Kelly.

The hero is not quite as manly or stoic as we usually have seen in that genre, but the narration is strictly according to formula.*spoiler ahead -- but is it really?*The &#34;mystery&#34; is far too easily solved, besides, and our hero dispatches a vampire with far too little trouble.

541,"This book begins with an overview of how your body's pH level can alter your general feeling of wellness, as well as inhibit or cause/allow certain illnesses and diseases to take hold. It discusses the causes and contributing factors to wonky pH levels. There are lists of foods that are alkaline and acidic. The text generally advocates eating more vegetables, green powders, and drinking freshly juiced fruits and veggies, which is something I can get behind. Next it covers minerals and other supplements you can take to restore balance, and exercises and other ways to deal with stress (which can affect your pH levels). It would have been nice to see more footnotes or sources throughout the text, as I've learned to be critical unless there are reputable sources and research done on the subject matter. I still think the information is really interesting, if only because it's another way to understand the amazingly complex machine known as the human body.The book is pretty short overall, but it explains its purpose clearly and presents the information about how you can begin to correct your body's pH. The writing is clear and direct, and is essay-like. It's well edited.People looking for alternative solutions for common (non-serious) ailments might enjoy the information presented in this book. I do urge people to seek the advice of licensed medical professionals for anything that seems serious. Still, it might be worth it to try some things that this book talks about, just for general health reasons.",neutral,book

5892,"I really wanted to like this book, as I am a sucker for books set in Southern California, especially places where I either lived or visited many times. Palm Springs is in the latter category. While the opening chapter had promise, with its details of the real estate industry that ring true to me, the rest of the book was very disappointing.First of all, if the book was written in 2004, and there is no indication that it is a period piece set in the 1960s-1980s, then why name the protagonist Henry (outside of the royal family, I don't know many Henrys, especially one born in 1942: book set in 2004, Henry is 62, etc). And his wife's name was Irma? Why not Cynthia, or Nancy, or Linda -- names that were popular during the 1940s and don't have a whiff of the 1920s or 30s about them. They were married in the late 1960s -- not right after VJ Day! This may seem minor, but I have little interest in reading about a Henry, or an Irma, even though she dies before the story opens. It ages them for me --- gives, at least to me, an impression of a really, really old married couple.Next, there is far too much detail about the little things in Henry's life -- the razor Henry uses, what kind of sandwich old Irma ate before she died in their Las Vegas hotel room, the list goes on and on. As another reviewer noted, this seems like padding to bring up the word count. And the author jumped around with the back story on Henry and Irma -- I thought we were through with the back story, and there it comes again, right in the middle of Henry walking around the house where the murder took place.I am glad to read that the author is going to revise this book. I hope that he tightens the action, and doesn't give us every little detail of Henry's morning rituals, etc. as though he were Marcel Proust. As to the names --- well, we are probably stuck with them....I will keep checking for the revised version, as I still am hooked on the setting, and I admire anyone who takes the time to write and publish, knowing that he or she is opening themselves up to criticism.",neutral,book

8760,"Despite a promising start, this story disappointed me. If the read is rather short, easy to absorb, it is also a little disjointed. But the coverage is beautiful ...Thus, opening with a drowning and a visit to the emergency room from the heroin, I was really attached to my book. I really enjoyed myself while turning the pages. Ditto when she was followed by shadows on her way home. I enjoyed the anticipation. However, once the author presented me the monster, I began to stall. This deadly creature is not detailed enough, not enough to be described as one that should be avoid. And from this point, what had been a nice story began to annoy me.Melissa, who wanted to have a taste of independence became the shadow of Mike. Unable to stay alone, she is always whining and waiting for Mike to help her. A very immature heroine...As for Mike, the reader knows almost nothing about him. Only that he manipulates the girls and he plays with his glamour and attraction. Not necessarily a hero to whom I wish to believe in or to support.In terms of the love story between them, it is very light. Sometimes I even wondered if there was actually an attraction on Mike's part when you see how much he puts the brakes. Sure, he always has a good reason...Big disappointment also with the Twilight's references. If the first one could have been humorous, going to the theater with a vampire and compare your adventure with Bella and Edward, I thought it was a bit heavy.Yet the potential is there. I liked the idea of &#8203;&#8203;vampires, a little retro, who prefer to use tools of the century in which they died and who are skeptical of modernity. It was interesting. I also liked the start but it is as if the author had lost his concentration or if it had not been comfortable with the invention of his paranormal universe.I remain lukewarm and a little disappointed. Perhaps the author will succeed to surprise me in his sequel by offering a more detailed story that will not have you dropping along the way.Lucienewbooksonmyselves.blogspot.fr/",neutral,book
4714,"Enjoyable, low key mystery. Plenty of murders but not too much violence (in the way they are handled). 60 year old, unemployed man, is caught  up in The Case of the Murdered Cheer Leaders. Along the way he comes into the orbit of one fellow high school student, from many years ago, who was still in the mood for love. He, himself, has also been warned that his efforts to help the remaining former students, will bring on him the same fate as was meted out to his female classmates. A warm, congenial book despite the grim subject matter, l found it quite pleasant. The hero is a good companion for the time it takes to read the story, so, too, is his  security guard buddy, and, even, most of the police on the case.

3043,"And a little too often this novella crossed the line.  And, if I am being honest, I have to agree with the reviewer who said the Amazon blurb covers the entire story.  It does:  Ryan shows up at his sister's wedding after being threatened and kicked out by his parents; she welcomes him back with open arms and his childhood friend that he had a crush on protects and takes him in.  There's some explicit sex, and Ryan and Dan the standard sensitive bottom and alpha male protector, respectively.  So, why are there so many positive reviews?  Sometimes a reader just wants a simple ""happily ever after"" and this satisfies on that level.  No, it's not Shakespeare, or even a particularly original romance.  But, it is not the worst gay romance I have read and it didn't set me up for a great story and fail to deliver.  My expectations were low.  I wanted something with some sex and an HEA to while away the time while waiting for my plane.  I don't regret reading it, but it wasn't memorable either.  It was worth the price of an e-book.The lack of actual conflict or tension actually inspired me to read the sequel,To Keep and To Love, to see if the author develops the relationship or builds a plot.  Unfortunately, my expectations were too high and I was disappointed.",neutral,book
10381,"The hero and heroine aren't that great, but the plot is excellent with a mystery to solve and a marriage to save. Emily is one of my least favorite character types - afraid of everything. Afraid to love her husband because he might break her heart again, afraid to attend any ""ton"" events because people will not accept her, etc... And worse, instead of telling her husband about her fears, she resorts to manipulation to solve her problems. On the plus side, she has a good heart and ALWAYS has the best interests of her loved ones in mind. Lord Whitmore is another of my least favorite characters types - selfish. He does warm up and evolves into a good husband and father to Emily's niece and nephew. And once he gets his priorities straight, he puts in the effort to be a mind reader to figure out what will make Emily happy.Overall the book was an enjoyable read because the plot is very interesting. The H/h are both flawed but balanced with other good qualities and as the story develops they become more likable. The writing is excellent and well edited. There are multiple explicit scenes which can be skipped if that's an issue for you. I'd recommend this book if you're in the mood for a good mystery/romance.",neutral,book
9553,"Vivi Andrews is always good for a witty, comical escape.  No matter what, I've enjoyed all of her stories, but the differentiator between I like her story and I love her story is definitely the length.  Both of her full length novels as part of this Karmic Consultants series are five stars.  This story is actually the first in the series and is not required to enjoy the others, but it provides a nice background and introduction to important characters.Lucy Cartwright is essentially a counselor for ghosts.  She helps them resolve their issues and to accept that they are dead so they can move on to the white light.  Unfortunately, you don't get to pick which ghosts come to you and since Lucy has been going through a dry spell romantically, she apparently is broadcasting her horniness to the dead.  This means that every horn dog ghost with unfulfilled sexual fantasies are visting Lucy with the hopes she'll be able to fulfill their cravings.  Of course it doesn't work that way and she can't even touch the ghosts, but she calls her boss Karma to see what she can do and Karma advises that she needs to get laid.The next day, Lucy is dragged out of bed by the pounding on her front door to find a strange, but hunky man on her doortstep and it's lust at first sight.  He introduces himself as Cox and tells her Karma sent him over so Lucy is mortified thinking Karma has sent her a gigolo to help her with her problem.  The thought of paying for sex is debilitating for only so long before she rationalizes she needs to get over her morals and succomb to temptation.  While she's entertaining fantasies in her head, the conversation gets a little awkward and it turns out that Cox is actually private investigator Jake Cox, Karma's brother, and he's there because Karma had a vision that a man who was recently murdered would be visiting her that evening.  Jake is investigating his murder and trying to track down evidence that will bring the murderer into custody.  Jake and Lucy have to wait it out together with the strain of their attraction since Lucy has to remain horny if she wants the ghost to show up.This story was fast paced with laugh out loud moments, but a whole lot less beleiveable, yes even with ghosts, than a full length novel where characters get a little more depth or there's more than your hookup within moments of meeting one another.  Although Lucy and Jake move on to be recurring characters in future books and actually a focal point for book 3, The Sexorcist, there really isn't much development of their relationship here beyond the physical.  Still, it's a light enjoyable escape and a great foundation for books 2 & 3.",neutral,book

10043,"REVISED 05-06-13: My initial inclination was to rate this set 4 or 5 stars until I realized it TOTALLY and consistently ignored Austen's use of italics in all her major works. Where Austen italicized a word for emphasis, this Bedford edition doesn't do so. Nor does it use all caps to equal italics, nor even before-and-after underlines (_like this_) the way some other editions do. When this was priced at only a dollar, some readers might have been willing to overlook this defect (if they were even aware of it), but now that the price has doubled to $1.99 (the same price as 2 superior editions in the Kindle Store), one shouldn't have to. I consider this a serious enough flaw to rate this Bedford edition only 2 stars (and as a fan of Jane Austen, I was sorely tempted to even rate it one lower).Some readers of this review may wonder why I consider this worthy of criticism. I do because Austen (whose wonderful works rate 5+ stars) was a true wordsmith; she meant precisely what she wrote and the manner in which she wrote it. The words she chose to emphasize contribute to the way she intended her stories to be read and understood. Since she is not excessive in her use of italics, when she does so it is significant to the precise nuance or witticism she is trying to put across. That's why it IS a big deal. Without italics, something of Austen is lost. Reputable print editions all have them; why not all ebook versions? Why not THIS one?Except for this defect the Bedford Park edition provides easy access to each title and to the chapters within each title. It provides the finished and unfinished novels plus a sampling of juvenilia. And the formatting is fine--except for the aforementioned lack of any indication of emphasis throughout (a defect which seriously mars an otherwise fine set).One can get virtually EVERYTHING Austen wrote for the same price ($1.99) from Delphi and from Palmera. (To see for yourself, type ""Delphi Austen"" or ""Palmera Austen"" in the Kindle Bookstore searchbox.) Delphi uses italics in 4 of the 6 major works; Palmera in 5 (so I lean toward Palmera). I did NOT recommend this Bedford edition when it was priced at only a dollar, and I do not recommend it now at twice that.",neutral,book
9625,"Lila Dubois has some kind of wicked imagination when it comes to ice in the bedroom!I liked this book better than then second one in the series.  I thought the characters of Runako and Margo were well drawn.  Getting a sense for Runako's pain at his sister's tortured death at a research facility and the internal dialogue for how he feels about Margo when he has all reason to hate humans makes it a book well worth reading.  Margo's sassiness really comes across, but her finally getting over her self esteem issues made me cheer.What made this book much better for me is that it takes place in the monsters' home in the mountains, and more than just the three main men in the books, you meet others and get to witness how they live, how they mourn, and even how they love.

11325,"This story features a slow simmering burn that starts in Tess and Joe's hearts until it eventually consumes their entire being. This is not the type of love story that would traditionally interest me but the notion of an Englishman falling in love with his housesitter piqued my interest. I'm very thankful that it did. While this type of story may not be something I would normally read, Secrets is definitely a book that I would read again.Tess and Joe seem to have much similarity, yet many differences as well. Both seem to have a stubborn streak in them, and a quick wit that makes their banter truly entertaining. They both harbor secrets they are not willing to relinquish while still seeking to learn what the other is hiding. Tess has a stronger inner strength within this story than Joe does. She is willing to throw caution to the wind and see where it takes her. It is one of the reasons she took the housesitting job in the beginning. Joe however, seems to be a little more reluctant to change, and clearly has demons in his past that continue to taunt him.The love story between Tess and Joe is not the immediate mind numbing attraction that many love stories have. I actually appreciated this different type of growth and it made this story stand out from many others I have read. I like that Tess and Joe start off as acquaintances who eventually grows into a friends that graduate to becominging lovers. While this may sound like it may be a little too slow or drawn out it actually read very well and keep me interested and wanting to find out more. Even after I completed the book, I remembered the characters' names, which with the amount of books I read is a feat within itself.This is a story that I would recommend to anyone who loves a good love story whether it be a traditional romance or a more contemporary one. I think that all fans of romance could really curl up on the couch or in the bed and loose themselves for hours while learning Tess and Joe's secrets.Originally posted at the Long and Short Romance Reviews.",neutral,book

I do believe Mr. Williams accurately displays how current society has no staying power in relationships. Instead of working through things, it's easier to toss it to the side and start anew with another. Which is exactly what Preston is doing and his conscience is working overtime trying to save him. He fails to acknowledge how his actions or lack thereof are affecting his current and unborn children.

Instead she was a seasoned woman with a plus-size figure.  And she maintained that size throughout the book, which I love because all too often the heroine somehow miraculously loses weight and you're wondering why the hero is still attracted to her when her curves sold the deal in the first place.Overall the sex scenes were a little eye opening but I was fine with that and this was a good read.",neutral,book
2149,"I only recently discovered this author, having read one of her other stories which was a complete winner. This one, however, just didn't measure up.To be fair, the writer is very talented and, in terms of technique, is well above and beyond many of her contemporaries who are churning out e-books with glaring errors, inconsistencies and poor grammatical structure. My issue with this story was that the hero and heroine simply didn't engage my interest.The heroine seemed a rather insipid character and the hero was supposed to be an alpha male, but he just didn't dial up the heat for me. First, he's introduced with a beard (yuk! Though he does shed this soon after) and then he goes on to provide a pretty lacklustre performance for the heroine's first time (double yuk). Probably quite realistic, but not what you're looking for in this type of book.That aside, there is nothing too wrong with the storyline, which is why I still gave it three stars. Having said that, I ended up ditching it before three-quarter time.",neutral,book

10338,"I am a very avid  book reader and have been a beta reader for a couple authors. This story was sorely lacking and characters made little sense. First we have Kasie who was written as a woman firm in making sure she was no longer going to be controlled and manipulated and she is kidnapped by her former fianc&eacute;e. She does not know it's him at first and does nothing but allow herself be thrown into a car with a hat over her head and tied at her neck and she makes no effort to yell, fight and get away! What an insult to women! Then she finds out it's Chay and she does nothing still? Please! She hasn't seen or spoken to this man in eight years! She makes no effort to get away when they stop at a hotel, no effort when they are at the store later, just complaining to the store owner she's been taken against her will, but let's the store owner dismiss it! And all the time in the cabin she complains but let's him get away with speaking to her with attitude when he is the one in the absolute wrong and acts like she doesn't have the right to be upset and mad. Hello?! He committed a federal offense! Not even to mention that he committed a wrong to her. And no one so much as tells him how wrong he is, just is like oh, it he's a good guy and they're sure her dad has his reasons? Pahlease! The story lacked true character and depth. It fell too short of reality. Yes it's a work of fiction, but it still needs to make sense and it is a story of real people, not an alternate world or paranormal scenario.

5386,"This is the first book in a Regency series of six books by Shirl Anders about the Archangels, a group of former spys.  I previously read the 4th book in the series,My Lady Taken (Archangels), not realizing it was part of a series.  I enjoyed Gabriella in that story, so I wanted to read about how her relationship with Drummond came to be.  In the editorial review section of Amazon, they give an excerpt that involves Drummond spanking Gabriella.  This is the heaviest that the BDSM gets in the book, so I am surprised that it was chosen as an excerpt, as it is a bit misleading about the book.Drummond ""purchases"" his love from 25 years ago from another Lord who is ""selling"" her, because she is baron.  Gabriella soon discovers that Drummond plans to have his way with her, sexually.  Though she is reluctant at first due to lack of experience, she soon comes to enjoy her liaisons with Drummond.  The love builds between them, with some interesting twists threatening their relationship.I enjoyed this story.  While it is a quick read, taking only a couple hours, it doesn't feel short.

3773,"Ok, so I know the premise was slightly ridiculous. And I know that Lila pretty much prostituted herself out to Hunter to save her father's business but, surprisingly, I really enjoyed this book. It was just a well written story.  Parts that would normally make me roll my eyes somehow didn't.  Even though Hunter is demanding and seemingly merciless to Lila in the beginning, the author does a good job of getting us inside his head so we know he's not just being a jerk for being a jerk's sake.  In a way he was right,  it was a business arrangement and they both knew why she was there.  Lila is no pushover and I found her resolve refreshing without being overbearing.  The sex scenes are HOTTTT, yes, even when Lila can't stand him or so she thinks.  I loved the gradual progression of their friendship and the realization of their feelings.  Loved the scenes with Lila and the dogs, which allowed Hunter to first get a glimpse into his feelings for Lila and I enjoyed their dinner conversations.  When things got comfortable between them, it gave me the warm fuzzies.  I pretty much loved everything about the book. I knocked one star off because I thought that the way that Hunter chose to end their contract was unnecessarily lame and only served to throw in a twist. There was no need for that and it was the only thing that spoiled the book for me.  Of course, they got back together so all's well that ends well.This is definitely a book that I will read  many times over. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",neutral,book

3550,"""I'm a left-leaning organic farming peacenik, and you're a dedicated member of the military-industrial complex.""Soleil Freeman and West Morgan had a brief affair five months ago. Although they heated up the sheets, their short lived liaison was more notable for the fighting. Now, months later, Soleil is noticeably pregnant and still in semi denial. A child had never been in her game plan. Added to that, she is struggling with exactly how to (whether to) tell West. He is a Special Forces officer in the Air Force and has been back at his base in Colorado since their last and, as it turns out, most consequential encounter.But surprise! West has come back to town to take care of his father who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and he runs into a Soleil who has some explaining to do.After I read this book I was both very impressed and profoundly disappointed. I think my disappointment comes from the fact that this was a nice read, but there was a great read struggling to get out. There was so much here that the reader could sink their teeth into and, unfortunately, none of it got the treatment it deserved.This book touched on the following: political identity & idealism, divorce, single parenthood v. marriage, how children view their parents and vice/versa, the ways in which children internalize parental expectations, and how love works with all of these.I think the cover of the book is so incredibly misleading. It is not some bubbly tale of a secret baby. Soleil's pregnancy and her reconnection with West is the main story, but the subplots and secondary characters are very vital and interesting in the story and are much deeper than the cover implies. And therein lies my biggest problem. I was incredibly engrossed in West's struggle with dealing with the twin blows of impending fatherhood and the fact that his larger than life father was going through terrifying bouts of dementia. I was equally drawn in by Julia's, West's mother's, re-entry into the dating world (she and West's father have been divorced for many years) and the wonderful new guy she meets. And I was incredibly intrigued by the very prickly, yet fascinating relationship Soilel has with her famous, idiosyncratic mother. BTW, I loved Soleil's background -- her hippie, down with the establishment middle class white-bread mother becomes a radical and hooks up with a Black Panther who himself later becomes establishment thereby dooming that relationship. Lol. Soleil's mother is a One woman character play waiting to happen.SO when the book ends with only West and Soleil's relationship sewn up, I felt like I was cut adrift. Even the resolution of West and Soleil's relationship wasn't completely satisfactory. It seemed so incredibly rushed. The two of them were coming from fundamentally different places. I never felt the two of them came together adequately for each other. Sure they pledge their love, but it is a Harlequin, you expect that. I didn't completely feel it. Don't get me wrong, the author creates a great connect between the two but she really needed more pages to explore it more.And that is the crux of the issue for me. I think this book needed a good 100 to 200 more pages to really satisfy me. The writing here was very good and the characters were excellent. I simply needed more time with them.",neutral,book

The evil in Manchester House is palpable, the suspense menacing. I read each page with growing dread, knowing something bad awaited but not being able to stop.

7677,"Mostly what I liked about this book is the allegorical message. As far as characters, there isn't anything really new or amazing. The setting is interesting and the alliances for the upcoming war prove the author spent some time with world building.Most of the &#34;plot twists&#34; were easy for me to predict. This isn't unusual. I'm a writer and a voracious reader. If you can trick me and have the proper groundwork in place to back up your twist, I'm impressed.For me, the allegory is too plain here. It isn't preachy yet, but I suspect it might become that way before the series is finished. Of course, this makes me want to check out the next book to see if I'm right.While this first installment in the series does seem to have a story problem that is resolved (find the wielder) it isn't the main character's problem. His problem is feeling like an outcast in his home reality and I guess that is resolved in the story. It seems pretty easily resolved to me. The plot is strong for the story but the character arc is weak.If you like quests, magic, elves, dragons and battle scenes, you will probably enjoy this book.

Her submissiveness to him has its limits, even in his dreams, which surprises but doesn't disappoint him.

Steamside's inhabitants are refugees like Emily who long to return to their times. Why are they here? It's not clearly explained, and that's not a good thing, which is a shame because Steamside is interesting.Rather, the setting is used more as a backdrop to a juvenile, nonsensical romance between the two leads.

There were just too many creep factors for me, personally, to become that involved in the characters or even to find the love scenes all that erotic (in fact, I found them very bland).  The creep factors were:1. The three men are brothers, which I hadn't expected to be that bothered by but once I started reading I didn't find it intriguing at all or believable.2.  The female protagonist systemically ""corners"" each brother and practically begs for sex from each man in turn.  Just not sexy or romantic.3.  She's 8 months pregnant at the time.4.  They all call the child ""theirs""...he is ""their son""...as in they do not know who fathered the baby and so all claim him. Something about this went against my own peace of mind.  Maybe too...cult-like?  Takes me to number 5...5.  The entire scenario is so unrealistic that even for a book I couldn't suspend my disbelief.  The author writes the 4-way relationship as a pleasant, laid back one, with no jealousy issues or the woman just throwing her hands up and saying ""I need space, quit touching me for one freaking minute"".  All is perfect in their world, nobody minds sharing and they all know each other's business.  And sure, the heroine is well cared and the men genuinely love her, but at the same time she is overly cossetted.  It left me feeling like she had no real freedom, always surrounded by men hovering over her.  She didn't have enough of an independent spirit for the heroines I usually like reading about.

5850,"This book started off good, but somewhere along the way it got lost and went downhill fast. The beginning was really interesting wondering what is happening and who is doing everything. I loved the killers chapters and the way everything was slowly being revealed. One thing I did hate throughout was it was a bit too descriptive for  my tastes. Not horribly so, but enough that it kept making me stop and think really? Did we need that much detail in the description? It is one thing that can bug me. Like calling out every name band of everything - I don't need it. It always makes me thing of product placement in movies and tv - like is the author being paid to advertise for the brands?Besides the descriptive, I was enjoying the book. But things just unraveled about halfway through and the end...the end was just too much. Now I need to add some spoilers here so don't read ahead if you don't want to know. You are told how how the killer showed up at his house and he managed to get out of the handcuffs and get to his secret gun and shoot the killer, but not dead. Then when the killer shows up again he just happens to be right next to another loaded gun and he just happens to be able to again shoot the killer. It was just a bit much. My husband was just like what? He just happens to have loaded guns all over the place? Yeah. One gun okay - the shotgun that was his dead fiances....that I am not buying. Then I told him what happened after that and he was just like wait...the book isn't over yet? I said nope - it just keeps going! Really it went on too long. Like right after that maybe have an epilogue chapter where you sum up everything, how he went to get help and moved to NYC to be with the lawyer lady and how things are good now. I don't need to see him do all of that because...well because the story was over when the killer died. And the author should never try and write a sex scene into his books. It just didn't work.

Jamie Pepper undergoes an experiment to battle a disease of the brain. At first it seems effective, but is it really? Are these strange dreams he is having or is he doing things he is unaware of? None of it seems believable enough to me to warrant the climax. I will say that the life in the dorm aspect is entertaining and funny, but the novel as a whole was a big disappointment to me.",neutral,book

It further gives insight into a cruel and crooked world of power where those in power make decisions with little or no compassion for the people who are trying to survive and for those fighting for the cause the leaders in power sent them to fight for.I found the book long and tedious at times and I'm not sure I want to read the sequel.This is a book about a war fought by the survivors of a catastrophic climatic change with a hero that has seemingly superhuman tolerance to pain and suffering.",neutral,book

1035,"Keith and Abigail are an interesting leading couple. Both are alpha's (this is not typical for many paranormal/werewolf/vampire type books I've read) and strong. A leading lady that is strong but not hard and sarcastic is a welcome change for me. At first I thought Abby very smart - then she makes a choice I did not feel was in character for her and her strength sort of fizzles.I felt that the concept of a guide was good - that a new werewolf needed someone to help him/her control the wolf and learn about the community. Surprisingly that part did not seem rushed to me - I was fine with it. I thought the sex scenes were fine - they don't overwhelm the story nor do they seem contrived just for their own sake.What this book needed is about another 50-100 pages. Its true you hit the ground running but it leaves you with a quizzical bewildered viewpoint that just never really goes away. Too many unanswered questions.It needed backstory as to why the bad guy would turn Abigail, what he stood to gain from it, and why he so desperately seems to want her back. And her own backstory is flimsy - you just don't really feel her at all.Although there is some explanation of the politics of the shifter world it needed to be more in depth - as we are told repeatedly that there are bad alpha's and good alpha's and the good are becoming more and more scarce. I was very intruiged with that storyline and wanted a lot more depth and explanation of it - especially as the Main alpha Gavin didn't seem to have a ton of contact with other ""old school"" alpha's. It seems as if the story is going to devolve into an us vs. them...if so we need to be more connected to the ""us"" so we want to win against the ""them"".The werewolf/witch war also needed a bit of backstory - again another intriguing concept that gets barely a scarce mention and a very brief exposition. It would have been a much stronger book if we would have experienced Keith in combat - as it is we are just told.And that was my main problem with the novel - we are just told too much. It definitely had the feel of a series set up - the elements are all here they just don't fit into the puzzle as nicely as they could have. It has a very superficial feel. Like you are scratching the surface only and there is much below. It needed more fleshing out.However it is a quick read (very quick - all told less than an hour for me) and the characters are likable enough. It has great potential to develop into a wonderful series with more depth. I will be picking the other books up to read on my Kindle.",neutral,book
6262,"""Under the Eagle"" is the first novel in a series of novels dealing with Centurion Macro and Optio (""Second in Command"") Cato.  The novel opens with Cato, a gangling teenager, inducted into the Roman Army in Germany with a letter of introduction from Rome insisting that he immediately be made a Centurion.  General Vespasian balks at this notion but compromises by making Cata an ""Optio"" which is essentially a Centurion's second in command and assistant.  Macro and Cato's skills compliment one another since Macro is illiterate, which he takes pains to conceal, while Cato is a bookworm.  Most of the novel deals with Cato's coming of age as a competent Roman soldier and fighting-man.The writing in this novel is quite good, the plot is linear without becoming too passe, and the characterizations are very good.  The author does a good job giving the reader a flavor for what it must have been like to be a Roman soldier in post-Republican Rome.  I liked this novel well enough to pick up the second installment in the series.  RJB.",neutral,book

If so, she has room to learn and improve.The story idea was decent, some of the writing was good. The execution needed a lot of work.

While these types of sentences can give depth to a story, when such descriptive language is used multiple times in each paragraph it gets too flowery.Another issue I have is the cover and title. How embarrassing for anyone to see you carrying this around. It doesn't do the story any justice and could, in fact, scare some readers away. Yes, there are sex scenes. They are definitely not as X-rated as the cover and title would lead one to believe.I got this as a free download and, honestly, didn't know if I'd ever read it since the cover gave me the wrong impression.

8350,"I was drawn to this novel by the rather ""daring"" factor that the author had chosen a disabled protagonist - in this case, a deaf girl. Aside from that, it was a pretty disappointing read, going swiftly downhill. The relationships between Robyn and the wolf brothers was too sudden, especially her attraction to Kail - there was no doubt in her mind, not even any sort of inner cautionary voice - no, the moment she saw him she literally turned into an uninhibited sex fiend. As for his poor brother... TJ's sole presence in the book was to be made a mockery of and treated as if he were some sort of clowning duffus to be gotten ridden of as soon as things got a little hot and heavy between the two protagonists. And even then - when her brother finds out the truth - it turns out he knew all along! And don't get me started on the sex scenes! Actually, do get me started. They were NOT SEXY. Do we really need descriptions of body parts? And oh, he's so well hung - well what a surprise - aren't all male protagonists? And I hate, hate, hate the word ""milked"". Please. No. Not when you're discussing sex. It's just... gross.This novel read like a pale shadow of a Nalini Singh book. The concepts were almost the same, the sexual tension similar (although Arend did not draw that out nearly enough for it to be particularly steamy). But, of course, with one major difference. Singh is a good author.And sexual tension not withstanding - there was no actual action tension either. The characters hardly seemed to be at risk for their life, and I think this was just someone's wolf fantasy.Oh, and what happened to the big fight? The actual ritualistic fight for alpha wolf. It just never happened - the story just finished! 13% from the end of the ebook, I was quite surprised.Arend, perhaps your work gets better as you go along.

Andrews, with Serengeti Heat reminded me that not just the Canidae family can be in possession of hot Alphas.REVIEW: Ava Minor is the runt of the pride. The smallest, the slowest and the oddest looking {in her lion form} she really has no hope to get a man, or to have cubs of her own. On a mission to ""get some"" even if it is from a human in a random pick-up bar, Ava saunters into the local dive and sidles up to the best looking cowboy in the place. Her mission is just about accomplished when she senses her Alpha standing right behind her...""oops.""Resigned to being forced back to the ranch and lorded over by her four over-protective brothers - Ava would never expect that Alpha Landon would actually be hot for her and they would end up hooking up in her driveway. But as she begins to realize that it is probably just because she is in heat her fantasies about hooking the Alpha deteriorate. Well, at least she can have him for one night. That should be enough, right?Short and entertaining, Serengeti Heat was another great bit of PNR to come out of Samhain Publishing. The characters were charming and the setting was interesting. I definitely look forward to reading more from Vivi Andrews. My only negative regarding the book was that it wrapped up too nicely, but this is probably because of the word limit Samhain gives to these anthology novellas. I really expected a bit of back-lash from a few of the not-so-nice characters. ""Meow"" cat fight. Oh well.This is short read, and a very cheap listing, on amazon.com for $2.80 here. I love a good book deal! RECOMMENDATIONS: Adults only, a lot of happy coupling. PNR fans, shifter fans should enjoy.

So, even though this is a short read, it's really packed with a punch. Caitlyn and Sean are married, she wants to divorce him, he doesn't want his marriage to end. Sean is a cop who's got some bad guy after him and possibly anyone else close to him, so Sean needs to protect his wife much to her chagrin. Sean likes being in control and Caitlyn feels as if he doesn't listen to her which has caused some friction in their marriage. I liked this book. I really liked the idea of the story and the cover kind of hinted at some of the chemistry between the two characters and you shant be dissapointed!! What I had a problem with was because it was a short story, not all of the ideas that the author had could be developed fully. I would have liked to have witnessed the fight that led to their breakup. I wanted to see what their lives were like after she left.

Unfortunately, I was never drawn in by either the hero/heroine as they were cold untrusting people who were always at odds with each other. The other characters in the story were much more interesting. The constant mentioning of the heroine's issues with the color of her skin got very old and the story really began to drag during the second half.

The story takes place at Judgment-a secluded fortress type mansion that holds hundreds of women captive and who will be sold into slavery. Callie first given the name Red because of her hair and later renamed Mischief by her Master was kidnapped and brought to Judgment. When Mischief arrives at the compound she fights her captives and pays the price. Her defiance earns her attention from Tane-the head Master-on her first night at Judgment. Her defiance continues as does his fascination with her.Her defiance continues and that is what earns her the name Mischief. She is eventually broken when she tries to escape and lands in the arms of Tane. He sentences her to a caning and waiting she does something that earns her a total of 30 strikes of the cane.While we are learning about how Mischief was captured and tortured into complete submission the author also dives into the physiological state of Mischief. There are other interesting aspects to this story.  There is a whole hierarchy of slaves-the top being Personals.When presented with a real chance of escape I was shocked at her response-which really just goes to show you how beaten down and broken she really became.

6819,"4 1/2 stars.""Candy Houses"" by Shiloh Walker is the first novella in her Grimm series, a very different take on familiar fairy tales and fables. Forget everything you remember about the story of Hansel and Gretel and allow yourself to be drawn into this mesmerizing tale of Greta, a woman who survived the torture inflicted upon her by her evil stepmother and stepbrother and became a Grimm. Those who become Grimm have their work cut out for them, to protect the mortals on earth from the monsters who seek to destroy them. As each joins the hunt, they are granted increased fighting and survival skills but they are also given individual special gifts that are unique to them as well as a silver medallion that has wings and letters engraved upon it. Traditionally, they tend to hunt alone but also have resources they can call upon when needed and they all have interacted with the mysterious Will who has guided them on their journey and who interferes as he deems necessary. Greta discovers a new potential victim who inexplicably has access to a demon tome which is full of invocations for summoning all sorts of demons. Unfortunately, destruction of the book is not going to solve the problems that have arisen and Greta inadvertently requires the assistance of her Grimm colleague, Rip, whether either is happy with the arrangement or not. The two must learn to work together and deal with their past and present attraction to one another while they each fulfill the task before them or each will fail.A imaginative twist on a traditional tale that reimagines familiar characters with a sensual and intriguing flair. The contrast between the action-packed fight scenes and the flowering relationships plus the mystique behind the Grimm make this an enthralling read. The gradual introduction of tidbits about the various characters and the reinterpretation of traditional tales makes this an intriguing start to the series and whets one's appetite for more.

10185,"Blanchard & Beecher'sSecret Societiesis a product of it's time.  It reviews the fear and distrust many late 19th century thinkers had for societies such as the Freemasons, Marxists, and Anarchists, as well as their contempt for non-Christian religions.  When reading this book, however, it is important to keep in mind that these are the thoughts of two individuals who even in their day, were seen as fringe writers dealing in fear and paranoia.  Beecher, for example, was the abolitionist brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wroteUncle Tom's Cabinwhile Jonathan Blanchard was an abolitionist preacher well known for his inflamatory anti-masonic rhetoric.  One of their primary purposes in publishing this work was to reinforce the superiority of American-style Protestant Christianity over Hinduism and Islam, both of which had achieved a great deal of popularity among the New England academic and economic elites.  Freemasonry, another major topic in the book, had recently been involved in an event known as the ""Paris Commune"", where a group of Marxists and Anarchists temporarily gained political control over Paris.  Both Blanchard and Beecher were concerned that this movement would endanger stability in the United States where memories of both the Civil War and Reconstruction were livid, angry scars on the psyche of the nation.Secret Societies, therefore, provides keen insight into the logic and rational behind the deep concern felt by a generation of Americans that had seen their country torn by civil war and feared the rising popularity of Marx-inspired secret societies could lead directly to a renewal of widespread violence.",neutral,book
97,"Review contains spoilersThe premise of the story sounded great. Two men who grew up together, one gay, the other straight have to marry/bond for their clans to strike a peace. You see the guys aren't just guys they are werewolves. So, we have two great cliches in one story: 1.) forced arranged marriage and 2.) paranormal/werewolves.However, while the story has some hot chemistry between the two leads, Hayden and Josh, the overall drama is told in flashbacks, which take away from the present day tale. Plus, Samhain nor the author don't warn for the out-of-the-blue rape that occurs to one of the heroes by some off-screen criminals (which did nothing to advance the plot), and seemed pointless. So I can only give the book 3 stars. The premise had promise, but did not come to full frution.",neutral,book

3340,"This book has a rather farfetched, but interesting premise...that a group of West Pointers going back over a hundred years are secretly controlling the world.  Could have been fun, but the author seems to have strung together a number of separately written sections, while forgetting what happened in the previous sections!  Its nuts, i.e. characters show up injured but no injury was ever described, characters jump from one location to another with no connection, and there seems to be no point to any of it.Very poor writing, even worse editing (does this author even have an editor?).  Mayer needs to clean up his writing, and get it edited.  In addition, his plot is rather thin, and if he's going to go for the outlandish, at least make it a little believable.But my biggest complaint about the book is that it isn't even exciting or particularly interesting. This is no thriller, in fact it drags along so slowly, and fails to grip the reader to such a degree it is actually quite boring and laborious to plod through.Update: After reading the book, the ending was fairly good and some action sequences just prior to the ending were't so bad. So, I'm upgrading the book from one star and making it two stars.  All of my previous comments stand, and Mayer will hopefully turn out something better next time.",neutral,book

I wanted to read more, to find out how the characters developed and what happened to them as they made a go of their very unusual relationship.  I loved reading a book about a woman shifter.  Usually its always the men that are shifters so it was fun to read a shift through the eyes a woman.  The characters are heartwarming and really sweet.  Just wish they were a bit more fleshed out.

The whole premise was ridiculous and half way into the book I was thinking about just deleting it but I persevered to the end.Michael started out as really intense almost to a stalker stage. Kate started out as this really independent woman and in the end due to Michael's ""training"" she becomes a submissive - much to his delight...because of course only through being controlled, whipped, pinched, shackled, tied and treated like a dog will Kate ever achieve ecstasy and release to become the submissive she was born to be...because that is part of what the clan is all about - pleasure through pain. And Michael is the ultimate dominant that needs his submissive dog in order to be whole! Blech!!!!! Gag!!!! I can stomach a little BDSM but this type of sexual play is so demeaning. At one point he fantasized about all the purple bruises he will leave on Kate's white skin because that turns him on. Ok Michael...and uh..Michael also has an abnormally huge manhood that he hurts Kate with when they finally do have actual intercourse. Oh please!!!! Spare me!

11059,"I don't write plot summaries or include spoilers.I really enjoyed reading this book 2 of Ms. Arend's 'Granite Lake Wolves' series, which begins withWolf Signs: Granite Lake Wolves, Book 1. Similar to book 1 in that this is a FAST read. Given that, it is pretty satisfying. Good book to read in an afternoon if you just want a little relaxing fun. It would almost be as comforting as a good cup of tea... or is it the other way around?Characters are sweet- more sweet than sexy in this case. Both Missy and Tad come across as people you'd like to have living next door. Despite the fact that I wasn't drooling over them or caught up in their passion, their romance was well done. There was some background between the two which helped provide some depth and their sexual tension was fun to watch unfold. I chuckled in places and sighed in contentment in others.This series does seem a little light on the paranormal side- you don't really get to spend too much time on the shifting or their nature as wolves, but pack politics come into play- and certainly wolf instincts. This book had a bit more magic in it given that the Omega wolf was a key part of the plot.All in all, it's a light, uncomplicated paranormal romance series. Something to read for fun when you have time. It is light and romantic enough to be soothing. I will save the next one for a day when I need a little escape.FURTHER READING: if you like this, you'll like...Moira Rogers' basic werewolf romance series:Cry Sanctuary: Book 1 of Red Rock Pass seriesR.G.

I saw some promise in Caleb and Van, but wasn't at all fond of Anne through the whole of the story. I'm not really sure why, but she got on my nerves, I'm sorry to say.

7878,"This book filled a lot of gaps in the Lincoln story.  It consists of a series of anecdotes remembered by contemporaries of Abe Lincoln.  Many are humorous  stories or jokes that he liked to tell and many are reiterated by more than one person.  Some are sayings lifted out of speeches that he made, especially that occurred during the Lincoln/Douglas debates.  These stories are more or less placed in chronological order from Abe's boyhood days through his whole life experience and end the evening of his assassination as he prepared to go to the Ford Theater.  These saying as remembered as coming from the very mouth of the to be 16th President prove that his was a life-long aversion to slavery in all of its forms.  I have read opinions that his interest was in the preservation of the Union more than the end of slavery, but I think these quotes from Lincoln's own mouth show his horror and outrage against slavery from his early manhood, not to minimize his desire to preserve the Union.Another area is Lincoln's faith.  These stories from Abe's own mouth show his devout faith in Christianity, the Bible, and prayer from his boyhood, and his ever intensifying faith as the horrors of the Civil War ran their course.  I have read opinions by contemporaries in his law-practice days that Lincoln was an atheist or at best an agnostic.  No statements of that nature come from Abraham's mouth in this book, and if at all true would seem to reflect a stage of questioning in his early professional days before he became a candidate for office.Several more observations can be made:  I did not know that he had been in love twice before the alliance with Mary Todd.  One girl named Anne or Annie had been engaged to someone from the East before she was enamored with Lincoln.  The eastern swain had gone back east to get permission from his relatives as he considered himself to be of a higher class and needed the permission of his family in order to marry the western Annie.  During the absence of the Easterner, Annie sickened and died.  Abe was devastated.  He wept at her grave and was disconsolate for a long time.  Mary Todd was his third love.  I hadn't remembered that  another suitor of Mary's was Douglas, the Little Giant, Lincoln's political rival.  Douglas was short, round, and well-dressed.  Most would have predicted that he would be Mary's choice, however, she unpredictably picked Lincoln, the ungainly, rustic giant.  It was commented that Mary saw the diamond inside the rough exterior.Another interesting thread was the many threats and assassination attempts that were made against Lincoln's life from the beginning of his political success and his unconcern about them.  He stated that he believed his life was secure until his Maker called for it.  He astounded people by evading his body guards and taking unusual risks.  In the last days of the war, he visited the front lines against all advice.  By the time the hue and cry arose to forbid such a risky act, he had already been there and safely returned.This collection was evidently put together and edited quite close to time of the events.  Much of the language is archaic to my ear, and when explanations are made to help the reader understand, they are still geared to a much earlier generation.  Some of the jokes lost their humor for me because of the archaic language.  At that time, the general public evidently thought that three of our presidents had been poisoned for political ends as their vice presidents would be more favorable to the desired policies.  These stories were not given as controversial but as the accepted opinion of the day and were mentioned to show that there were grounds to believe the story of a White House kitchen worker who said he had been offered a large amount of money to poison the milk of the Lincoln household.  (The teetotaler family drank milk as their favored beverage.)  The poisoned presidents were considered to have been William Harrison, and the Generals Taylor and Scott.",neutral,book

They share a house and their lives but that is all.  Cassidy wants more.Ian is scared to commit.  Scared of being hurt he pushes away those that mean the most to him; hence why he and Cassidy are now friends instead of the lovers Ian wants them to be.Kye McClellan is a gypsy of sorts. A jack of all trades, he enjoys helping out where he is needed.  He never stays in any place too long before he wants to enjoy freedom again.  When he goes home with Cassidy to help her with her business and financial records, Kye never expected to suddenly want a home and hearth.  And that scares the heck out of him. Before he leaves, however, he will try his best to get Ian and Cassidy together in each other's arms, where they belong not knowing that he will want to be the final part of their triad.Not a typical m&eacute;nage romance, Our Man Friday is a bit different.  I am used to having one couple already established prior to inviting a third and so the fact that Ian and Cassidy were just friends was original to me.  Cassidy's invitation to Kye was a bit far fetched because in this day and age, I don't see anyone inviting an unknown stranger into their home to sort through and look at financial records.  Kye was hot, I'll give him that but he angered me more than once the times he left Ian and Cassidy.  Ian and Cassidy's relationship evolved into something beautiful thanks to Kye.Our Man Friday by Claire Thompson is erotic and naughty.  The emotions of the characters are realistic but I just didn't buy into Kye's commitment to Ian and Cassidy.  I felt he was gratuitous towards them.  As a m&eacute;nage, Our Man Friday is scorching hot; as a true love match between all three characters of the m&eacute;nage? Not so much.

With that under his belt, he can quit his low-paying job and apply for a much better paying job at a much more prestigious gallery uptown. The only fly in the ointment is the presence of his former boyfriend Shep, a closeted actor who can&#8217;t seem to stay away. On the plus side, there&#8217;s a hunky though apparently straight detective on the scene who seems more than a little interested in Caesar.The picture isn&#8217;t quite as rosy the next morning, when Caesar arrives at the gallery to find Shep passed out, naked, in the bathroom, and one of the centerpiece busts from the show missing. The stolen artwork is just the tip of the iceberg, as Caesar and his friends are drawn into a web of strange alliances and blackmail. Along the way he finds out that Detective Dan isn&#8217;t what he seems.&#8220;Catch Me If You Can&#8221; is a rather pleasant mystery story. There&#8217;s a bit of screwball comedy to the story line, which could have been played up more. The humor definitely comes through, but doesn&#8217;t quite hit the mark. The same could be said for the mystery itself. It didn&#8217;t quite gel, at least for me. Somewhat curiously, the issue here is that there&#8217;s a little too much going on. That&#8217;s usually not a problem for mysteries, but in this case there are a lot of scenes that actually pull you away from the plot to deliver a political or social commentary, which often buries clues and leads to the mystery.On the plus side, the two main characters have great chemistry together. It&#8217;s not all sweetness and mushy romance; these two have to work a bit to make a real connection. Caesar and Dan are surrounded by a large cast of equally well-drawn characters. The characters alone make this an above average read, and with a tighter plot it would have been even better. I would actually give it 3.5 stars.",neutral,book

In response, the US invaded and occupied Turkey to the purpose of suppressing the Kurdish objection to being exterminated. As a retaliation for the US supplying arms to the Turks and now for the US soldiers actively assisting in the genocide, some Kurds infiltrate the US to start a campaign of terror to get the US out of the Turkish / Kurdish fight. This is the setup and bluntly, at that point, I was ready to drop this book as perhaps too depressing to continue just due to this scenario. I mean, who is the bad guy at this point?Well, the author makes sure that the Kurds in the US are painted as so evil that you must side against them, but I keep thinking of those thousands of Kurdish villages so casually dismissed in this book on the way to making the Kurds and the leader of the terror campaign evil incarnate. Don't get me wrong. I have no tolerance for terror, but also have none for genocide either. The book offers a choice of nauseating alternatives for the good guys.As to the unfolding of the story (FBI and allies to stop the terror campaign) a good deal of the 'action' is laughable. Here are a few examples I can cite without spoilers. If I were willing to do spoilers, this review would be thousands of words long and a lot funnier.The Kurds are depicted as heartless superbly trained killers yet when they use a captive to lure others into a trap, they untie the captive sufficiently to allow him to signal his rescuers that this is a trap. In another scene, the gimlet eyed Kurdish assassin is charged with stalking and killing a victim. Rather than just shooting the victim, the assassin, in the best James Bond tradition, grabs the proposed victim up, puts her in a car and aimlessly drives around long enough for her to engineer an escape. In another gripping scene, this trained and expert assassin shoots a victim (with a 9 mm pistol) at close range, in the back of the head but she not only lives through it, but doesn't even seem to have much of a headache.In another asinine setup, the FBI needs to question a bunch of good old boys in a country bar to find the location of another country boy who may know the location of the terrorists. A reasonable tactic would be entering the bar and just saying ""We're the FBI looking for the terrorists. Can you tell us the address of So and So?"" That would have worked, but instead, the FBI female dresses up in costume to use sex to winnow the address from one of the bar's patrons. When that doesn't work, the FBI (and FBI ally) end up shooting, beating and terrorizing the patrons until they get the info they seek. Yikes! These guys are rednecks from Arizona. If you asked, they'd take up arms and attack the terrorists themselves. No need to shoot and beat them.One more example. After the terrorism starts in the US, the law enforcement community starts a manhunt, of course, to find the terrorists. They can't find them but when the Maryland mafia decides it wishes to find them, it does so in about 15 minutes with no explanation except an oblique comment about tracking them through their sewage. After the mafia finds the bad guys locale, it fails to inform the FBI for most of the book which gives the bad guys some more time to commit atrocities.I haven't even gotten to the superhuman powers some FBI agents have or the utter stupidity supposedly committed by senior White House staff - all utterly unbelievable.If you just want to rah rah the US and  can dismiss the portrayed genocide of Kurds and can suspend disbelief when superhuman FBI agents get stymied by bozo Kurd terrorists, this one is for you. If you are sickened by the killing, then perhaps not.",neutral,book
7044,"I love the Attracelli family.  Gus didn't catch my eye in any of the previous books, but Alana certainly did and I thought it was great to get more of her back story as well as her love story!  Gus is just as sexy and alpha as the other Attracelli men, but Alana's determined to fight her attraction every step of the way. With good reason, since she's been burned pretty badly by marriage before. I love her do-gooder activities, her time with the kids, and her horror that people are more interested in whether or not she and Gus kissed last night than in giving some orphaned kids the opportunity to make it in life.Elizabeth Lennox has fast become one of my favorite romance authors, but the Attracelli family as a whole are my favorite characters of hers that I've found so far.",neutral,book

You can touch the link at Psalm 1:1 but all that does is bring up every chapter and verse (sans the actual text) and you still have to scroll through all of it to get to Psalm 150:1. This is useless.

The cover is just perfect and, though I usually don't really pay that much attention to covers, for some reason this one set the characters for me exactly and I could see them so well. I loved the relationship development here - and how each man comes to grip with what being out in a small town Texas environment could cost. The secondary characters were well drawn and this one had a lot of emotion. The dog was a bit of comedic relief and it was very funny at times. Edward was outwardly so sure of himself but inwardly full of doubts and wanting to really believe. Great read!",neutral,book

4789,"This wasn't a bad read but it was flat and under developed. There wasn't a strong conflict which made you anxious to turn the page. The premise of the book was that  Andreas, the H, blackmailed one of his employees, Saskia to pretend to be his fiancee so that his grandfather would not pressure him to marry his older cousin whom he really hated. Typical Harlequin plot which can still work if develop but the blackmailed centred around his accidental meeting with Saskia who was shamelessly flirting with him because she mistook him for her friend's boyfriend whose loyalty was being put to the test by Saskia and her friend.Andreas used this incident and the threat of losing her job to blackmail her to pretend to be the fiancee. This was to me a weak basis because her supervisor's report showed she was a top employee with a lot to offer the company and there was no basis to fire her. The h was compliant as she did not insist that he hear her side of the story and he and his cousin insulted her with little protest from her.Also, there could have been more interaction between H and h. There was too much narration, ie hearing what was going on in their heads but not much talking to each other. Because of this I couldn't believe that they fell in love and so quickly.I would still recommend this book but can only give it 3 stars.",neutral,book

8268,"For centuries, the Prime have been battling their brutal enemies, the Antareans.  Facing extinction as they struggle against escalating Antarean attacks, the proud warrior race begins the process of uniting with the Galactic Alliance to ensure their future.Captain Wulf Caradoc, as the heir of the Prime leader, is expected to assist with negotiations on behalf of his people.  The secret, secondary part of his agenda is to look for his gemate, the genetically ideal mate that will be bonded to him mentally, physically and emotionally until the end of his days.  The ambassadorial team he is assigned to escort is attacked by space pirates hired by Prime malcontents.  Despite their skillful defense tactics, Wulf, his crew, and their charges are in danger until Alliance forces can reach them.Captain Melina Dmitros is a top-notch Galactic Alliance officer who's paid her dues.  After receiving a distress message from the Prime ambassador party, she steps in to aid them.  When she finally meets the future Prime leader face-to-face, she is ambushed by the biological force of the Prime mating urge.  She is his gemate, his fated match and a Lost One.  Her body will not allow her to survive without him, regardless of how she feels.  Wulf is willing to do whatever it takes to claim and protect his mate so that they may persevere against their enemies.The action kicks up a dust storm in chapter one of Prime Obsession that never settles!  I was convinced that Captain Dmitros was a first-rate adrenaline junkie from all the non-stop battles.  I rarely encounter a novel with multiple action scenes per interval.  Melina takes on bad guys, dodges hits, sniffs out/repairs sabotages, and keeps time with her man.  It's all in a day's work for a woman that knows her way around the Prime as well as the Galactic Alliance.  Wulf is growls and nibbles when it comes to his mate, although he's more than earned his formidable Prime warrior and sex machine title.  However, Melina is always center stage and in the thick of it all.  I started to feel that she was beginning to upstage her man.  Ok, ok.  Admittedly, I do prefer strong, accomplished female antagonists.  Still, Melina proved a bit overwhelming at times.Wulf's growling seemed uh, well...ridiculous after a while.  I've read novels with alpha males expressing their protectiveness this way, yet the constant repetitiveness became excessive and silly after a while.  Of course, it was a relief to have Wulf take charge after watching Melina prove just how tough and skilled she is over and over again. I could better appreciate the developing relationship.  The author does an amazing job of revealing the awakening gifts from a gemat-gemate pairing. Once I got a grasp on the dynamic, it was okay for the plot to charge ahead.Prime Obsession is a fast-paced space opera outfitted in shiny new gadgets and modern characters.  If you're looking for a sci-fi novel brimming with loads of techno jargon, intergalactic intrigue and angst, you've come to the right place.  Melina and Wulf's chemistry decimates small planets.  The ""foreplay"" preceding their first time together behind closed doors covers way too much ground; it dangled on the storyline string a tad longer than I would have preferred.  The romance and dialogue occasionally feels dated, although I could appreciate some truly cute moments.  Monette Michaels' narrative style is clean and precise with crisp visuals that flow easily from scene to scene.  All in all, it's fun to be kept on the edge of your seat for the bulk of the ride.  That's no easy feat in a story with so many subplots and secondary characters.  If this is just the first installment, then the next episode will have to put in some major overtime to keep up.PatriceReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",neutral,book

4712,"This is sci-fi non-consensual pet play/age play - heavier on the age play than the pet play.  I'm OK with non-con capture fantasies, so that was't the big problem for me.  It was Bach actually having an internal moment where was uncomfortable with having sex with what he thought of essentially an animal - and then goes ahead and does it without reservation later.  The author does try to mitigate that later, but it takes a long time until he actually views Pani as a person that he treats as a pet, not an actual pet.I don't have an issue with spanking books, so much as when the spanking goes from &#34;correction&#34; (as it is euphemistically labeled in so many books) to abuse - serious over the top beating for really no reason at all - which this book does.  I also struggle in general with age play - why would an adult think having sex with a child is a good thing?  This book never really explored why treating somebody like a toddler would turn them on any way that could possibly be deemed socially acceptable.I gave it 3 stars because the writing was very good - the world building was good, the characters were well developed.  I went on to read Pani's story because I was hoping that it would help me understand why the age play was erotic - and it did help.",neutral,book

Nash is attracted to Stacy, but he doesn't want to lose his position as pack leader by chosing a human as his mate.PROS: I thought Nash and Stacy were likeable and sounded attractive. The story begins very well.CONS: I had a hard time respecting Nash and Stacy. Both of them made so many poor decisions that were stupid and born out of obstinance. I actually found this story to be depressing. I believed that Nash and Stacy were hot for each other. I don't think they knew each other enough to love each other. That Stacy knows that Nash and his friends are werewolves contradicts the original story where her friend is told that if she tells anyone, she will be killed. At the end, the author skips two years. After this, two important characters are brought up, but neither of them are given names. (I can't give away who they are without giving away key plot points.)

And I know I've read alot of books that don't refrain from using it or other choice words.Anyways the idea of the story isn't terrible but I didn't like any of the characters all that much. Everything happened really quickly which it had to since this was a short story. The humorous thing was that Linda the woman that is dead(ish) hung around looking for her body and she was constantly screwing around with her ex-boyfriend/murderer. She was not a great character but once in a while did something funny. Like choosing Mike's wardrobe for court.

11555,"I have read other books by this author and I had great expectations for this book that were not met.  I was very disappointed. I was expecting a deep romance with a perceptive, empathic hero and a heroine who had been royally screwed by her fiance and sister.  This book was just rushed and weird.  It was like the author was in a hurry and left out details and wanted to throw way too much into this short book.First, there were alot of things just thrown in and blown over.  I cannot recall if I read what the heroine does for a living.  Also, there was alot of drama surrounding the sister running off with the fiance on the wedding day but there were no details given about the sisters' relationship before the incident.  There is the mention of a few other visitors and employees at the dude ranch but they are all glossed over. There is another man interested in thd heroine briefly.  He is given about 2 pages.  There is very little character development and I did not care about any of these people.  Even the sex scenes were skimpy and rushed.When the heroine goes to the ranch, there is a little drama with another woman who is chasing the hero but even this was confusing.  It was really not necessary to the story and the drama was not fully developed.  Just thrown in here and there almost like an after thought.Also, the heroine spends the first part of the book disliking the hero just because he was handsome and she was attracted to him, I think.  Not really sure why.  He spends all his time telling her he knows she does not like him.  That is the extent of his perceptive empath abilities.The secret is frankly, stupid.  I won't give it away but I guessed it pretty early.  I was hoping I was wrong because it really did not fit in with the story.  When it finally came out, even the reveal was less than satisfactory.  I cannot say more without spoiling this.The interracial aspect of this novel was non-existent.  There was a BRIEF mention of race and that was all.  These people could have been blue for all race mattered.The ending was a complete rushed cop out.  It really felt like the author realized ""oh yeah, I need to write a last chapter"" so she did so without any real buildup.  If you cared about the characters (which I did not), you would feel cheated by how fast their ""conflict"" was resolved and how.Two stars because this author has done better and she did make the effort to write this book.

We had starters -lemon and coriander chicken and haryali fish Tikka. Main course, chicken biryani and schezwan egg fried rice were our choice.

We got 2 of them as complimentary with GOLD.
starters were amazing - especially, fish was juicy with smoky flavor. Quantities of both chicken biryani full and fried rice was huge. Biryani can easily serve 3 for main course. Service was extra ordinary. Totally worth the GOLD visit. Looking forward to try other dishes here :)",positive,restaurant

3246,"It was a lunch and was very hungry thought to head towards this place.
.
.

The place is quite good with spacious sitting area and decent ambience.
.
.
There are many varities available to eat where its mojitos, soups, starters, maincourse and the desserts not to forget the softdrinks the most important thing.
.
.
Had started with the lemon corriander souo and the arabian chicken soup....the best liked by me us the lemon corriander where the flavour of each ingeredient used to make the soup was felt in each sip.
..
..
Then the best to go with is the starters which includes the variety of eatables like fish hariyali, paneer papdi kabab which was good but less salt, lahori chicken kabab which was just awesom to have the tastiest one I had in a very long time, then comes the marg achari tikka which is again can stand against lahori kabab, then fish 65 was good , the golden fried babycorn which was so srumptious and welked fried ,then the veg sheek kabab which was the worst thing I tried honestly was not at all cooked properly no salt no chilli just wet piece of vegetables felt in mouth could not even eat that.
..
..
Then went ahead with prawns which was good ,then comes the crispy corn chilli pepper which was again a good one to go with.
..
..
The main course had the mouth waterting fish and mutton mandi which was really good but can be more organised if served more hot...the fish and mutton were cooked perefectly with soft texture felt......and not to forget the veg fried rice with manchuria again makes it fit to eat
..
..
Then had the virgin mojito and the kitkat shake which were perfectly made.
..
..
The most awaited and favourite part the dessert section
Which had the gulab jamun
The shahi tukda
The kuddi ki kheer
The khubani ka mittha.
...
...
Was happy and fulled after having this many varities of dishes.
..
..
Must visit this place to have a good experience of varities of different hyderabadi eatables.

Starting from the reception area *( especially that guy with a moustache... You made the night with your behavior).
After entering the lounge, it kinda of creates a pleasant view with all the interior decorations.
The service was good starting from the starters to the drinks and main course and finally the desserts.
But at the end of the night it was the DJ guy who outperformed everyone. You will be the one who will make me to come to this place again and again. Being from North India, finally got the chance to dance to those Punjabi songs listening to which I have grown. Danced with the heart in my palm. Needless to say that the DJ guy was the icing on the cake with his song selections.
In short, a happening place and if it's your day then these small things will just make your night.",positive,restaurant

4647,"I got to visit this place through a giveaway by @hyderabadfooddiaries and it was worth a visit. We tried the bamboo chicken which is an iconic telugu appetizer that has soft tender chicken cooked with right amount of spices. Mamsam vepudu which was the star of the show with spicy, perfectly cooked mutton that justified it being telugu cuisine. The Rajugari Kodi Pulao was the best of all.
This pulao had a different taste and texture, unlike biryani, this dish is similar to a porridge with soft chicken and delicious curry. This place has huge variety of appetizers, curries and rice in chicken, mutton,seafood and veg options.
Best destination for spice lovers👍

3839,"As far as date nights are considered there is music, lovely ambience, tables over looking a golf course and of course some rains to give you respite from the hot summer. This was my dinner night with Naina at Glass Onion, a beautiful restaurant at Boulder Hills, Hyderabad. The best thing is definitely the vast lush green golf course which gives joy and you are definitely chilling out at the finest properties in Hyderabad.
.
Let’s take the food starting right off with beer battered fish and pizza it was all perfection at affordable rates. The beer battered fish was soft and finely fried. Lovely textures I must tell. Pizza was thin crusted and we chose a veggie pizza, called Four Cheese Pizza! Yea as you wonder it has all the right mix of different types of cheese and we just loved it. A classic wood fired pizza flocks!!
.
The penne had an attractive aroma when it reached our tables, and I must say I forgot to even take a better picture before we start digging in. It was delicious and completely uplifted the mood. We surely had our drinks to give us great company and must tell ya, the Stallion a whiskey based cocktail made with passion fruit, lemon juice and grapes were simply fantastic. Make sure to use your Zomato gold in good use here.
.
The cherry on top was Apple pie our parting order, such a warm dessert served with delicious custard sauce, almond praline topped of with vanilla flavoured icecream. We surely enjoyed this dinner and this place is a great find for couples to have a romantic dinner.

2138,"Best place Ever Jonathan's Kitchen

If you are near Gachibowli and are planning to have a perfect lunch or dinner so I recommend you the best place is Jonathan's kitchen, where you can visit with your family and friends. I really loved this place from it’s ambiance to food and service, everything’s top notch.

It was Wednesday night and we were near Gachibowli and really hungry, when I suggested we will visit Jonathan's Kitchen, it is my favorite place to hangout. I was with my five friends and we started our dinner with their special starters Grilled Pomfret, Chili chicken , Crispy Corn , Chicken Wings, Nawabi shikampuri kebab, Dragon prawns and Tiger prawns. All of the starters were the best, I have never tried such before anywhere. Now that the starting was the best, I promise at the end it will be a blast.

Grilled pomfret was tasty and soft to bite, it was properly cooked with perfect spices and we ordered this twice. It was so good! Chili chicken wasn’t much spicy, it was well equitable of spices and the best starter to start our dinner. Crispy corn I have tried at many restaurants and I loved Flechazo’s before, but now I can say the best crispy corn is at Jonathan's kitchen. I think this is the best compliment. Chicken wings for this just one word magnificent!

Then my favorite part were the prawns. Here we tried 3 different types of prawns, Butter Garlic prawns; this is just out of the world first time we have tried this really the taste is unforgettable, Dragon prawns; one of my friends suggested me to try this here, Mr. Tarak, the name itself represents dragon prawns. It is the best in prawns compared to tiger prawns, Tiger prawns; these were too large in size, I have never seen the size of prawns like tiger prawns taste also too good it was the best to end our starters.

Then we ordered some mocktails because it’s mandatory; Orange delight ,Cucumber n mint, Virgin pina colada ,Black current, Spicy tango and Blue lagoon or blue heaven. Every mocktail has their own specialty. Orange delight and cucumber n mint were the winners of the evening. Black current is really good in taste and refreshing. Spicy tango and blue lagoon were the ultimate mocktails. Every mocktail is best at Jonathan's kitchen.

Then it’s time for main course, in that we ordered Dal Tadka and Rara Gosht with Butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha, and Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy. Every dish just left us speechless! Dal tadka and rara gosht tasted absolutely great with butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha. Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy was the ultimate dishe to end our phenomenal dinner at Jonathan's kitchen.

But without dessert, I never end my dinner. So here we ordered Gulab jamun, Chocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream and Cream brulee with Fresh fruits. All the desserts are just marvelous to end our dinner.

Thanks to Mr. Rashid for the lovely dinner at Jonathan's kitchen. Thanks to the entire team of Jonathan's kitchen who served us in a very good way and special thanks to Surrender and Chef vijay.

8700,"found them on Zomato website, a very interesting to say that this restaurant carved a niche in serving juicy  chicken wings with wide spread of 10 to 12 sauces especially Texas BBQ, Spicy garlic too yummy and spicy like Original hot and Amazon wild comes in to top of mind. Did ordered their bulk wings of 20 pieces and chicken drum sticks tossed with theses sauces were amazing. Dyna pasta served here  with white sauce is a perfect balance with a little spicy. Over all they have apt combination of mojitos like lemonade and strawberry one can have a very good combo. Biryanis served here us very special like Wings Biryani and drum sticks have a large quantity matched quality as well. over all its a best and only to discover a new taste of their popular chicken wings at a very reasonable place.",positive,restaurant

I ordered Gobi chilli and tossed noodles combo(medium) together with one gobi chilli extra.
Veggies overloaded in noodles and the sweet,sour and spicy flavor in gobi chilli was astounding. It's been 2years in Gachibowli and this turned out to be the best chilli and noodles I have ever had here. The garlic aroma in gobi chilli and the sourness was remarkable.

7282,"Absolutely delighted with our overall experience. The shop had an excellent festive decoration. Ideally there would be very little to talk about the ambiance of a takeaway cake shop but this place is an exception. The moment we entered the place along with it's festive and classy decor and the maddening smell from the kitchen where cakes were being baked we were instantly transported to a different place. They mostly have ready cakes, cookies and cupcakes that can be bought at the counter and there is a good menu to order and take away later. The price at the beginning might look a little but wait till you have tasted either the cookies or the cakes. We were at loss of proper adjectives and were totally delighted. The brownie was perfectly baked with taste of butter and the other ingredients adding to the flavor. This was one of the best brownies I have had in a long time. We also bought the cup cakes and they were yummilicious as well. Want to try everything in the menu in future. Keep up the great work!! Will definitely recommend.",positive,restaurant

Cupcakes that edge sweet without being overpowering so I can share with the ""I don't like desserts that are actually sweet"" crowd. Don't be surprised if you gulp down the entire box in a sitting.

A fine carrot cake cupcake that almost makes you feel like you're eating ""healthy"" until you eat the luscious cream cheese frosting. That's one of my top favorites.

Life is short - eat sweets. Buy them here. Be happy!",positive,restaurant

We also tried few mocktails Virgin mojito, Kotkat milkshake and Chocolate milkshkae.

8358,"Now that s what we call some authentic chicken burger. They can give the big names like burger king and McD run for their money any fine day. These uber tasty charcoal grilled burgers are absolute food nirvana. The soft and tender chicken breast well coated with local desi masala(marinated ) are grilled till they turn golden brown. A double slice of the grilled breast serves as the filling for galactic burger; which is my personal favouriteThe burger buns are soft and sweet.

They have other options too like hotdog and sandwiches which are damn tasty. Basically their USP is the grilling process of marinated chicken breast which makes them uncontested winners of best burgers in cyberabad. The place is in mid of bustling DLF area which makes the place pretty accessible. You may have to be patient enough to catch hold of your burgers as it takes minimum 15 minimum to grill the patty.

They welcomed us with a welcome drink which was really nice.
First we ordered Screw Driver, Tropical Delight and Mint Cooler which was really good.

Screw Driver - It was a Cocktail which contains Vodka and Orange juice.

Tropical Delight - It had Orange, Pineapple, Mango and cream which taste differently. I personally liked that blend but my friends didn't. I would rate 3.8/5.

Mint Cooler - It is just normal Virgin Mojito what we gets in other places as well. Nothing special was not their. 3.5/5

For Starters we ordered Lotus Stem Galouti which was ok ok. The kulcha was bit hard so that we need to chew it more. 3.4/5

Next we ordered BBQ Roasted Chicken pizza which was good. The pizza was properly cooked but bit burned at the end which can happen. But that was covered by the taste. 4/5

Overall the experience was really good and it is located in a calm area where we can sit and enjoy with our kids or family or friends.

Looking for a romantic dinner? I would say this is one of the best place in Hyderabad. Amazing ambience along the poolside. My review is based on the session invite.

We started our dinner with Thai coconut soup. Perfectly cooked veggies like carrot, broccoli, zucchini dipped into the coconut milk. It was very tasty.

In starters, we were served Beetroot paneer Tikka and Sikampuri kebab. Plating was very tempting. Paneer Tikka goes really well with the chutney they served with it. And the kebab, it was the best Sikampuri kebab I have ever had. Perfectly cooked and moist inside.

In mocktails, they suggested their best sellers which were apple cooler and minty mango. Apple cooler was little tangy and minty mango was on sweeter side. I just loved the latter one. It was very refreshing.

Then comes the main course. We had Malai kofta - modak shaped kofta layered with cashew curry. Sweetness was balanced and delicious in taste. Must try with their herb paratha. We also had Stuffed capsicum - one of the famous and ultimate dish in India. If you have only curry, you may find it salty, but have it with capsicum and you will feel it like a heaven.

In dessert, I had brownie with vanilla ice cream. Brownie was nice, soft, crispy outside and moist inside.

Overall, my experience was amazing with Mazzo. Bhuvnesh - the main chef is very humble person and his suggestions were really helpful while having a dinner. I also enjoyed the service from their courteous staff.",positive,restaurant

Visited this place for a rather late lunch, say somewhere around 3/4.

Ambience - Simply classic and sufficiently spacious (at least,we felt so because we were the only customers in the restaurant.) This place reeks of class & elegance from the moment you step inside the elevator. The place is brightly lit and relaxing. Though the rooftop view is breathtaking coupled with sitting by the poolside, we preferred sitting indoors.

Service - Gopal was our server for the day. Courteous and meticulous, he helped us with suggestions for dishes more suitable for our tastes. The staff overall seemed to be attentive and polite.

Food - We ordered two drinks(I can't recollect the names, sorry for that) and they arrived promptly at our table within no time. Ordered Caprese Bruschetta and Creamy Pesto Penne Pasta.
I've tried Bruschetta at other places but never savoured it the way I did here. The freshness of toppings was evident. The pasta was sufficient for two and that again, was a delight to eat. Had to rush,hence couldn't try the desserts.

Overall, dining at Mazzo is an indulgence. The prices might seem steep for some, but for the experience it provides, it is definitely worth a visit.",positive,restaurant

This German word can be loosely translated to snobbish or haughty, but these words do not describe my impression of them as well as “hochnäsig” does. However, that is not all they are. They are in fact one of the best bakeries in Hyderabad and one can very well understand where their pride comes from. I said one of the best and not the best for three reasons:

1.    This place is expensive.
2.    Except for the cupcakes and brownies and occasionally the chocolate cake, everything must be ordered at least a day in advance.
3.    They don’t sell cake-slices. You must buy the entire cake, which you must order in advance.

Now coming to the gooooooood stuff…

Brownies:
The best I have ever had! The chocolate is rich, deep and the brownie itself is light, moist and almost melts in your mouth. I know some of you may say that that’s not how a brownie is supposed to be, that it is supposed to be dense and gooey and you may be right. BUT, try this one for the flavor and its melt-in-your mouth quality.

Chocolate Cakes:
I have tried one of their Classic Chocolate cake and Triple Chocolate cake. All the chocolate cakes are made from the same batter as the brownies, so each one of them is rich, moist with an excellent, deep, chocolate flavor. The best one is clearly the Triple Chocolate cake.

Carrot Cake:
To me there are two kinds of carrot cakes. One is the desi kind that you get at Parsi bakeries, which is moist, dense, has khoya/mava and cardamom even. The other kind is the fancier, videsi version, which has nuts (mostly walnuts), cinnamon, a cream-cheese frosting and is drier. Labonel being a “fine baking” place naturally has the latter kind. Although I am not much of a fan of this kind because of the cinnamon, which in my mind always over-powers any dessert, Labonel’s carrot cake is the best I have ever had in this category.

Cheesecakes:
I have only had one of their cheesecakes, blueberry I think. It was a right amount of fluff, fat, sweetness and flavor. The base was delicious too. However, the cheesecakes at Eclat or Chili’s are slightly firmer, hence a bit better.

Cupcakes:
Cupcakes are their only product that I am not a fan of. They are too small, the frosting is a little too soft and in my opinion add no value to cake. You can give the cupcakes a complete miss.

Cookies:
Choco-chip, Double chocolate and white chocolate/raspberry and the only 3 kinds they bake. Soft, rich, moist, chewy and yummmmmmm…

Miscellaneous:
There are some seasonal cakes like the honey cake or the plum cake. The honey cake is ok, but the plum cake is so loaded with rum that it can make a teetotaler a little tipsy.

Overall, if you don’t mind spending a lot and are a cake fan like me, then don’t give this place a miss.",positive,restaurant

Located on roof top in Indra Nagar , you get a good view of tall office buildings that have crowded Gachibowlli and Hi-Tech City. The place is dimly lit, but I guess that is on purpose to set up the mood and if you are a party animal you are most surely going to get engrossed by the music in no time. The DJ plays all the trending tunes and it is sure to make you sway. The staff is courteous and prompt , despite the high density of crowd that gathers here during weekends. The food is quite affordable and also appeals to the taste buds at the same time. I have visited this place 3-4 times and have never been disappointed.

836,"Review :

Recently we've received an invitation from Hyper Local. It's on the 3rd or Top Floor of SLN Terminus, Gachibowli, just next to Platinum Cinemas. The place is located in a good, open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer. And if you go there before Sunset, you can enjoy the dawn. The Ambiance is pretty good, with:

Full Bar

Nightlife

Live Music

Private Dining Area Available

Wi-Fi

Live Sports Screening

Indoor Seating

Smoking Area

Buffet

If you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues, this is the perfect place. Their food is pretty good, with reasonable price. I find the prices are on the lower side, than any other nearby cafes.

They are serving IPL Live Screening with Bucket Bonanza where you can get 4 pints of Beer including a veg/non-veg starter. But you need to remember the Entry is restricted to adults, no kids allowed.

Anyway, yesterday, I went to keep the invitation. It was around 6:15 pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after 8 pm anyday. I asked to serve their specialty, so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail. First, they served LSD, which is a kickoff cocktail, made with 5 types of liqueur, like Gin, Vodka, Tequila, Rum & Triple Sec. and made with freshly squeezed Orange juice. Triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur, made from the dried peels of bitter & sweet oranges. And with the use of Fresh Orange juice, the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well. I was eagerly waiting for the Mocktail. Thought of trying the non-alcohol drink first, then the cocktail. The mocktail was served along with Chicken Taco.

The mocktail was made with Fresh Kiwi & Mint. The flavor of fresh ingredients were significant, made the drink so refreshing. Usually in bars, they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice.

After that I tried their Chicken Taco. Those Tacos were made for Indians, so you can't get the blunt taste, but the real fusion works here. Those Tacos were stuffed with Indian spiced grilled Chicken and topped with mint raita and served in Malabar Ghee fried Parotas. Taste wise they were so good, but the only thing which bothered me, the Malabar Parota. As the parotas have layers, so it was difficult to hold the entire thing. so, I suggested to use plain Wheat Four/Maida Tortillas, I believe the taste will also go better with the Indian spiced Grilled Chicken. And yes, the Tacos were too filling, I could have only 2 of them.

Now it's time for the Cocktail, which was literally inviting me to taste it. And believe me it was kicking off,so strong, but nice Orange flavored & very refreshing. I could only finish the 3/4th of the entire portion.

The stuff were insisting me to try something else on food. I left it on them, so they suggested me to try their signature dish Chicken Sambousek, what is that? That is Baharat Spiced Chicken Keema cooked & folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried. Served with 3 types of dip, Mayo, Mint raita & Sweet Tamarind & saffron chutney. I liked to try these Sambousek with sweet Tamarind chutney, it went so well together.

Now you might be wondering what Baharat spice is? As per the Chef, the word baharat actually means ""spices"" in Arabic and not a single spice, but a blend of several spices. In this blend you can find black pepper, coriander, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon. So, the chicken keema was cooked with these spices. Though the Sombousek looks pretty similar with Samosa, but the taste was very different. And that's why the 3 different types of dips were served.

I felt the food quality & quantity is quite enough & satisfactory as per price. Definetly overall 4.5 out of 5.

Already written about the ambiance : 5 out of 5

Location is also easy to reach : 4.5 out of 5

Service was a Professional & efficient : 5 out of 5

As per my experience, young people have a great option for a Bar Cum Restaurant which serves both quanlity & quantity of food & dink on reasonable price, with nightlife & live screening & beautiful ambiance.",positive,restaurant

6034,"Here is my Review!

LOCATION:-
Very easy to locate, it is very near to IKEA, a prominent landmark in Hyderabad. Its on the 4th floor, also rooftop option is available in the evening time. 

AMBIENCE :-

Once you enter the Pub, the interior will blow you away. The unique point about PH7 is the view it provides through big windows of the hustle of Gachibowli and high-rise buildings around.

FOOD :-
I tried lot many things here ! Here is the detailed review of every item:

MOCKTAILS:
-
PH7 SPECIAL MOCKTAIL- It literally holds the name! The most colorful mojito I ever came across, the flavors will tickle your taste buds!

BLUE SEA- Its so beautiful to look at! The blue shade darkens down the bottom which contains lichi cream and makes this mojito special for sweet lovers.

PINA COLADA- You might wanna skip this one, I found the flavors not complementing each other.

FLAVORED VIRGIN MOJITO - Most recommended drink for hot summers. Refreshing, minty and relaxing !

SALADS:-
STIR FRIED VEGETABLES- The main thing about the salads is its seasoning, the taste of the cooked veggies was so good. They could go a bit less on the oil though.

VEG SPRING SALAD- It gives you the authentic taste of the vegetables, the dressing of the salad and spices used makes it tasty!

MAIN:-

BUTTER PANEER & ROTI- I prefer Paneer curries to be spicy and buttery, and no doubt they nail it! Its pretty heavy, I was almost done with 2 Rotis.

SICILIAN PIZZA - The pizza was stuffed a lot with toppings, cheese was a bit less. You can mention to add more cheese to make it better. It was okay overall.

CRISPY CORN - The presentation of the dish was unique and catchy. The taste was anyway a bit different from my liking, as i prefer it salty n spicy, and not sweet. Could be my own preference. You can still try it out.

OVERALL:-
Pour House 7 is the go-to spot if you're around Gachibowli and are hunger-stuck! I would surely recommend this place. Do try out in the night-time and enjoy the rooftop :)",positive,restaurant

Few starters were also placed on a small conveyer belt in a corner which consisted of , chat and fish. later actual starters were served to us on our place. For a non vegetarian prawns and all kinds chicken is a must try. For vegetarian chilly paneer, crispy corn, chilly fries. Here you can make your own pizza as well which helped us to gain some more space for the meal later. The Mediterranean pasta is better than the white one. Later we hurried for lunch because the sweets were waiting. The food was also good. In sweets the gulabjamun with badam kulfi and jalebi with rabdi was good. Even try pan ice cream.
The staff here is courteous and friendly as well.

3254,"Recently we were invited for a food tasting session here at Marsala Food Company! We had heard mixed reviews about this place soo wanted to check out how it actually is! Well to start with, as soon as we entered we were quite impressed by their interiors and their seating arrangement! They have the Arabian style of seating i.e sitting down on with the food placed on stools and also they have the normal high table seating for people who don't wish to sit down! The place is dimly lit and very calm! You can enjoy the food with an overview of the traffic passing from infront of the DLF gate no 3, opposite to which is this place Marsala Food Company! So after we settled down they brought in the soups, we had the Arabian Chicken soup and the Lemon coriander soup! We just loved the Arabian Chicken Soup, it was really tasty and the chicken pieces were very tender! Whereas the lemon coriander soup was a bit spicy which is quite unexpected and also we felt it could be a little more improved! Next came vast spread of starters including both veg and non veg! The starters included Chicken pahadi, Paneer papdi, kung pao mushroom, Dragon chicken, Haryali fish tikka, Golden fried prawns, Golden fried babycorn, chilli paneer, lahori chicken kebab and mushroom moti tikka! Starters were really good in taste! Specially the non veg and seafood starters! Chicken pahadi, a dish prepared by marinating the boneless pieces in fresh mint, coriander, ginger and garlic paste and yoghurt, had a very refreshing and delectable taste! The chicken pieces were really tender and very properly cooked! The dragon chicken was a bit spicy and juicy but really good in taste! The golden fried prawns and babycorn are prepared by marinating them in the battered paste! These are really crispy and amazingly tasty! You definitely are going to love the starters here! ❤ Next they brought their famous Mandis on our table which included Mutton Juicy Marg Mandi, Grilled chicken Mandi and Fish Fried Mandi! Although all of them were good enough the one that stood apart was the Grilled Chicken Mandi! The rice in the mandi is very flavorful and yummy! And the chicken is grilled to perfection making it juicy and tender! The quantity was also ample...it can serve 4! In between all the starters and the mandis they also served us their milkshakes which had kitkat milkshake, Butterscotch milkshake and strawberry delight! Strawberry was our favourite! Made of fresh strawberries this shake gives you a refreshing taste and also You will order for another one 😉 And at the end of it all, we were served the desserts...the desserts which You commonly see in the Hyderabadi functions! They had the Qubani ka meetha, Double ka meetha, Kaddu ki kheer and Gulab Jamun! We strongly feel that they should improve on their desserts! They were just okay-ish! Dessert is the way to Man's Heart...soo it shouldn't be taken lightly! But overall it was a good experience here at Marsala, the staff was really nice and friendly and the food except for the desserts was really amazing! Do try this place...specially for their starters and the grilled chicken Mandi! 😍",positive,restaurant

5397,"Had the “Prawns Phad Thai Noodles” and “Veg Greek Salad”.

RATINGS ::

1. Food Quality : 5/5
One word: Fantabulous!

2. Food Quantity : 4/5
Veg Greek Salad - Medium bowl
Prawns Phad Thai Noodles - Large Bowl (5-6 big prawn chunks, egg chunks, variety of other veggie chunks)

3. Food Packaging : 3.5/5
Decent packaging. Hot on delivery.

4. Value for money : 4/5
Bit pricey on scale. However, the quality is flawless. Worth it!

--------------
1. Prawns Phad Thai Noodles :
Big chunks of prawns (around 5-6) with Thai style noodles. Best part was the additional veggie varieties (cut in style) and egg chunks added to it made it stand out beyond just regular prawn noodles. Veggies were carrot, mushrooms, cucumber, onion etc.
Moderately spicy. A drink like ‘lassi/buttermilk’ would complement well.

2. Veg Greek Salad :
Standard fresh veggie salad containing cucumbers, tomato, black olives, onions etc. with a happy twist of creamy raita. 
The cream and raita accentuated the taste of the salad tenfold. 
True exhibition of healthy yet tasty food.

Also, their bun is slightly different, which tastes even better over others.  The chicken was quite juicy with all flavors dumped in. Unfortunately, it is overpriced!

Coming to their staple food, they are great as well. They got tons of options, so not possible to review all of them here. But, I would highly suggest having their Death by Chocolate.

Ordered
Soup :Jade chicken, chicken manchow
Starter:Teriyaki chicken,Chicken banana leaves
Main course:Wolly chicken, Chicken fried rice, Chicken Haka noodles

Every dish I liked. Jade chicken soup was something new for me & having spinach in I was wondering how it would taste. But to my surprise in was too good.Terriyaki chicken was excellent. chicken fried rice was something that I dint like much but Haka noodles was a good one. Would recommend to visit there once as they also serve small portion which is really very innovative & helpful for customers to try more dishes.

They bake fresh bread everyday and each of their items look so good. There is a variety of options like bagels, custard buns, brownies and croissants. I also tried their multi grain bread which has flax seeds, millets and other healthy seeds. It was totally yummy!

6075,"Today I visited this place called Pour House 7 in Gachibowli.The place has indoors as well as rooftop seating.The rooftop seating gives you a panoramic view of the area and is breezy and well lit.The indoor seating is more of like a party space which will be ideal for small to medium sized groups.Coming to the food it was really mind blowing.We tried a bunch of items and majority of them tasted great.Lets have a look at the items we tried starting from Mocktails to appetizers and main course and ending it with desserts.
Firstly we had Tandoori Malai Broccoli which literally surprised me.Who had thought Broccoli could be that tasty....It tasted amazing with a creamy taste to it.Next we had Crispy chapa which is basically crispy crump coated fried fish with curry leaves seasoning which gave it a unique flavour.This was an outstanding dish and all of us loved it.Morrocan Chicken sticks was our next item and this one was also pretty good.The chicken was slightly smoky with a good amount of spicy seasonings on top.The chicken was nice tender and juicy too.I love seafood and so I ended up ordering a Jhinga Nasheela...This tasted good but nothing extraordinary about it.It was just good that's it.We also had Chicken Nachos which was served in a big bowl with lots of cheese and salsa and the right seasoning.Loved it.We also had a Bruschetta which was average.Along with these we also ordered Aalishaan Chicken sandwich which I would say was not at all aalishaan.This was not good.It lacked the right amount of chicken in it and was overall not tasty.Next we had a Nawabi Chicken pizza and it was really good.The topping was great with lots of chicken and cheese and was true to its name but the down side of the pizza was its base.The pizza base was really hard and dry which overall brings down the dish but I still had it because of the amazing topping.We had a platter of Fish Fingers and fries and it was excellent.Both the fish fingers and the fries were good.
After devouring all these starters we could only go for two main course dishes and so we decided to go for the Special 7H Biriyani and Spaghetti Aglio-e-olio.I am in love with their biriyani.It was not like any other biriyani that I have ever tasted before.It was unique and it was excellent too.It has a completely different flavour from all the other biriyanis in Hyderabad and I could not guess what's the secret ingredient was.The spaghetti I would say was decent but was definitely not among my favourites.
Now coming to the desserts we had vanilla ice cream and Gulab Jamuns.I would say the dessert section does not provide for much choices.The Jamuna were decent.
We also had some moctails in between which were not up to the mark.They need to improve their moctails.The only one I felt was perfect was the Virgin Mojito.Other Mocktails we had were not good.We had some litchi based ones and orange based ones and also a pinacolada flavoured one.But we did not like these much.

Overall I would say that the place offers really good food and the ambience is also great.The drinks need immense improvement.Thats it folks.This was my review of the place.Hope you like it.",positive,restaurant

I got my hands on their starters like

Chicken Pahadi kKebab
Chicken Banjara Kebab
Kung Pao Mushroom
Paneer Papdi Kebab
veg seekh kebab
dragon Chicken lahori Chicken kebab all the kebabs were fine what I liked the most among the starters were Kung Pao Mushroom dragon Chicken and banjara kebab and I felt that the veg seekh kebab was a bit dry and had no flavours apart from that everything was really delicious

Getting into the main course now I tried Mutton Juicy Mandi chicken Tangdi Mandi and grilled fish Mandi I personally liked chicken Tangdi Mandi as the chicken was well marinated and spicy as I love spicy food

Treating myself with the milkshakes and Desserts now in milkshakes I tried chocolate, butterscotch and KitKat I liked the KitKat one it was so deliciously topped with a scoop of ice-cream and then KitKat as a cherry on the top and in desserts I had gajar Ka Halwa double Ka meetha and kaddu ki kheer I liked kaddu ki kheer the most there was no major difference between gajar Ka Halwa and double Ka meetha my overall experience was good the staff were friendly and cooperative all I would like to say is its a good place to hangout with your friends for a proper Arabian meal !!",positive,restaurant

8473,"A randomly sudden decision took me and a couple of my colleagues to this place on a weekday lunch. we were unsure of our choice when we saw a few people sitting under the open huts and dining in the heat wave. But the moment I opened what seemed like a kitchen door, I was thrown aback to see 100s of people belting some South Indian meat. Man, this place is an oasis in the Puppalguda desert!
We being mutton lovers, ordered a nalli starter and charcoal mutton chops. looking at the crowd we were mentally prepared to go back to office in the evening post chai break but the waiter promptly brought the food in less than 10 minutes with a scalpel like tool with which we were to operate the nalli. Our eyes shone. The nalli did not disappoint us. we then dug into the chops. all my hours spent in drooling at pork ribs on YouTube were redeemed. this mutton chops did the deed. the meat wasn't the slimy, fatty kind melting off the bones, but was the perfectly grilled meat willing to separate from the ribs at our mildest effort. we were already dreaming of another plate but decided against it in the best interests of our bellies. then came the main course - rotis, mamasam pachadi and chicken biriyani. first bite of the mamasam pachadi threw our chairs back by 5 feet. we decided to ask the waiter to pack the biriyani and order another round of rotis to honour the pachadi. for a person who consciously keeps away from gongura chutneys, this one which clearly had gongura was just perfectly sour - a bit more sour and I wouldn't have cared to write this review. the meat was invisible. we had to spot a narrow bone in the pachadi to even know there was mutton. it was just mystically Omni present in the meat. I guess this is what you would call divine food.

6875,"Lovely European Bar with probably the best drinks hyderabad has to offer (No exaggeration)

Most of the drinks they have are imported from Europe and are supposedly not found any where else across India.

They also serve Trappist beers which are basically drinks brewed by monks for a charitable cause
And they also claim that all their booze is glycerine free without any preservatives and won't give you a beer belly

Everything aside they officially serve the smoothest drinks in town and I can vouch for that!!!! They're pricey but worth it!!!

Drinks-
Beer: La trappe Trippel (Bottled)
Witte
Beer sampler- (The caramel and cherry ones were my favorite)
Dubbel
Belgian Kreik
Chamborlette
Erdinger Weisbier
Erdinger Dunkel
Schuimpzuiper
Miss spicy - They mean it when they say spicy
Barbar blond (bottled)

Jenever shots (Pronounced yenever) (20% alcohol)
A type of Dutch Gin produced only in Europe with juniper flavour

These were absolutely amazing
The smoothest shots I've ever had

Smeets bessen Jenever - fruity gin with a sweet base
Citroen Jenever- Citrus flavoured shots with a tangy, zesty taste
Wafel Jenever- Hands down the best shot I've had. Ever.
Tastes like waffle syrup. Notes of caramel and pop corn. Sweet, smooth and simply sublime

Project 51- Brandy cocktail with notes of cinnamon and spicy jalapenos

Mango mint mocktail- Super sweet mango flavoured drink with a mildly minty taste

Food

Food was pretty good. We tried
Lasooni Murgh
Lamb chops - Tender and well cooked
Fries
Cheese broccoli- creamy cheesy broccoli
Florentine saute mushrooms
Chickpea corn masala - Good stuff to munch on while having drinks. Had alot of Peanuts.
Cilantro grilled fish- Tasted pretty Indian
Grilled fish with rice - Recommended
Saucy chest nuts
Chilli garlic prawns - Not very garlicky or spicy
Veg assorted pizza- Pretty good for a bar
Choco lava cake

The food wasn't too oily or spicy. Well flavoured and served warm.

Over all rating- 4.5/5 ( Only because there pricey)
Food- 4/5
Drinks- 4.9/5
Ambience- 4/5

So in terms of quantity a 5/5. Coming to the taste - The paneer was soft, the curry was well cooked and was tasty.

There is both indoor and outdoor seating at this place. We chose to sit outside as it got a beautiful view and it was just amazing with the view and the weather.

There is quite a large selection of food from Italian, continental to Indian. We ordered for some starters from which we really like Bakchoy fry and also Malai Broccoli, chilli potato and Red chilli chicken were really nice and if you like to have some soup I would definitely suggest hi for Broccoli soup. For the Main course we ordered some White sauce pasta, Grilled chicken with Lemon Butter Garlic Sauce, Vegetarian Fried rice and my favorite Pork Spare Ribs which was just Scrumptious and beautifully cooked pork. We also ordered a cheese platter with wine and I would suggest this for the people who love to enjoy and cheese and wine.

We had less food and lot of alcohol but people who are going only to eat some food it’s really not that expensive and it’s totally worth it for the view and for the food.

A very serene beautiful and peaceful place to enjoy a beautiful evening!",positive,restaurant
1150,"Have visited this place on 2nd October with my family to celebrate my sister's birthday. All the places were booked but luckily got seats in late hour for lunch. Place is not that huge but very well maintained, hospitality is top notch by their staff.

Coming to food, starters were served as well as barbeque was set up on our table. Chicken, prawns, mushroom, paneer and seekh kebab all were marinated very nicely. It was really amazing in taste. Potato prepared with mustard sauce was just wow. There was no dish which didnt disappoint.

Main course - This is the part where they have exceeded and crossed all the expectations. All the dishes were really good in taste, usually I skip main course and go for dessert after starters bit here I have tried and it was really good. Egg curry, chicken, mutton Rogan all were good. Biryani was also good. Noodles with sauce were delicious enough. It wasn't their just to keep up the numbers.

Dessert - My favorite part and completely satisfied my sweettooth. Pastries, please cake, kheer, brownie all were good. Kulfi was nice which was served with little bit of rabdi on the top.

Overall we had a ball at this place, from starter to main course and dessert all were really good. They didn't give us any point where anything can be deducted. Service was top notch as usual and value for money. This outlet is one the best on in Hyderabad hands down.",positive,restaurant

6601,"This review was long due. Located on the Khajaguda Road this restaurant claims to be part of the Gachibowli cluster and when I asked the owner he said he was just on the edge of Gachibowli and, therefore, technically they are in Gachibowli. The place has good parking and nice natural setup which has still been maintained despite the recent road construction.

Coming to the food we went for the Gulaabi Chaap after checking on Google, unfortunately this is the only place in India that offers this dish and we had no clue about the dish until we got it. Simply put it was amazing, mild rose smelling chicken cooked in the tandoor and served with mint sauce. It gave a heavenly feeling. Next on the list was the Chicken Momo which was soft and fresh again reminded me of some amazing momos I had in Manali. I hope some day they make Mutton Momos as well.

Butter Chicken was by far the best in town which went very well with another amazing bread called the Malai Warki Paratha. It was soft and was melting in the mouth with the Butter Chicken. Seemed like a match made in heaven. Much said about the main course we went for their version of Special Biryani. As is known from my reviews I don't eat too spicy food and this was just the perfect spicy level one could ask for. It had boneless pieces of chicken pan fried and served on top of the Biryani Rice. The taste was good and to my liking. Our Vegetarians friends were enjoying their Daal Makhni and Paneer Butter Masala which was again good and their Veg Biryani as per them was equally good.

Thanks to the friendly staff we went on eating for close to 2 and half hours without feeling the time passing by. The large projector added to the aura of the place and we enjoyed the IPL on the large screen. They offered us a 20% discount and another 10% on our next visit apparently one of their limited time running offer. Thank you aromas@11six for being such a good host and an amazing food.

We all came here with a lot of expectations and Marsala Food company didn't dissapoint us at all. We tasted a lot of items on the menu. The best and my personal favorite was the kit Kat shake. It was even better than the ones you get at the other shake outlets. The lemon Coriander soup was too lemony and was a bit sour and the veg Wonton Soup was good. It is not a must try and can be avoided ! Nothing special about it ! This was the only item that wasn't very good .Deep fried panner with a lot of masala ! Undoubtedly one of the best on the menu It is a must try and the special dish of the restaurant was the fried rice . the rice is topped with few Manchuria pieces and a lot of chopped vegetables. A treat for the mouth! We also ordered the veg curry and few rotis. We were all happy with the curry and rotis . The gulab jamun and the other deserts such as the kaddu ka kher and the double ka meetha were the stars of the day. Especially the gulab jamun !

4033,"This place is my go to place for continental food at Gachibowli. The food is absolutely awesome. My recommendations would be Doner kebab, any variant of their thin crust pizza and pork ribs.

The doner kebabs are filled with juicy lamb meat balls and topped with spicy mayo stuffed inside fluffly pita breads with a sude of humus.

In pizza, I love the pigs over a blanket pizza. The pizza crust is super thin and this place serves one of the best wood fire pizzas here.

In mains, the pork ribs just melts in your mouth and the stuffed chicken breast is deliciously with the filling of creamy spinach inside.

In desserts I loved all their creations from the baklava, to cherry chocolate cheese cake and to the old fashioned tiramisu...

It was raining and my husband wanted to have some coffee and that is how we landed up here. The place is very chilled out, there was no one at our table to check what we wanted to order despite the place being almost empty.

My husband placed the order for us,a mushroom omelette for me and a roasted mushroom makhani sandwich for him. I'm usually not a coffee person but the weather demanded a hot beverage and filter coffee was the first thing that came to my mind. We ordered 2 filter coffees and 1 bagel with cream cheese. The bagel was amazing with the coffee. I'm not a big fan of cream cheese but my husband is and he loved it. We made a pact to go for breakfast every Saturday mornings after this because I realised what an important meal I was missing due to my laziness :)

9315,"This place should realise that a dine-in restaurant has to provide some basic service and just having decent food is only the starting. The place offers good for nothing snobbish service by staff that cannot communicate and who don't give a damn about you. You can die asking for something and you won't get it. They don't even bother to keep cutlery at the table, not even tissue papers. The AC does not work and on a summer afternoon the place is like an oven.

Coming to food. If you manage to get what you like on the menu, it is a miracle. They open at 11.30. We asked for their weekend only dishes on a weekend at 1.30 and were told very unapologetic, rather rudely that they don't have it. Finally after we managed to find something that we liked and they had, we were told it would take 35 mins because a party of six had placed a big order. Now the taste. The ingredients are very good and fresh. The quality of pork is great. The taste doesn't have much variation. Everything is super spicy with just the proportion of sauces being different. After a while the taste buds just go numb with the spice. If this is how the food of North eastern India is, well, I'll avoid that geography. And I'll surely avoid this eatery. There is no excuse for bad and rude service!",negative,restaurant

Very less options of non-veg on the buffet both in Indian & western.
Only a chicken pie, & an oriental chicken dish inside. In the Indian had only Biryani & raara gosht.
The highlight was in place like Hyatt your serving Vada Pav as part of the sunday brunch, come on you must be really kidding me, I am sure you can do better than this. 😀
Lauki mussalam on the vegetarian spread just to name a few of the not so appetising options there. ☹️
Pizza was just like an Indian papad with some dry chicken and cheese on top.

As soon as I entered the first response from a person (Nikhil) at the front desk was ""Stag not allowed"". When I showed my phone and explained that I did call to do the booking, he said no. I was allowed after they realized that one of my other friends was already inside the pub and taken the table. It was so frustrating that treating someone so unprofessional and with a rude behavior. If you don't want to allow stag ...say it straight forward or put a notice outside so that no stag would even wish to enter. Don't change your rules according to your convenience.

The service was absolutely terrible... no air conditioning in the sweltering heat ... after multiple requests we got our food ( literally begged for the food to be served)... what’s not there on the buffet menu also they don’t tell the customer... the main course was served cold... pre-scooped ice creams.. and what not

Some mango juice they served... don’t know how that was drinkable ....

Worst decision to spend our evening here .. absolutely terrible experience

*I STRONGLY DISCOURAGE FAMILIES WITH KIDS FROM VISITING THIS PLACE*

*WRITING THIS REVIEW WITHIN 10 HOURS OF VISITING THIS PLACE*

Wish I could give a negative rating. This place is ridiculously lazy. No this review is not about food, cost or ambience. This is about people and their mindset.

810pm: four of us including two kids aged kids aged 2 and 7 step in

815pm: another large party and a couple of other families check-in

820pm: menu card was give to us

830pm: someone walked over to take the order but not before taking orders for other two parties (thug life!). We order Veg Biriyani, two rotis and Kadai Paneer

845pm: remind them about the order; said we need a couple of minutes

845pm: other groups already served food

850pm: remind them about the order; informed it will take another couple of minutes. My two year old son already started crying for food; elder daughter clearly getting irritated

855pm: again informed it will take a couple of minutes. i said I will walk out if food doesnt come in 30s.

856pm: our family walks out in front of the staff. Staff doesnt make the slightest attempt to stop us

The last part obviously indicates they havent started the preparation yet. So no loss in letting us leave.

The sheer apathy of staff was quite overwhelming. I can understand being profit centric and your obvious need to serve a bigger party. But with two hungry kids kept waiting for more than 45 min at your place without any food being offered smacks of apathy and insensitivity (after being reminded about it). And in this time and age of digital pervasiveness, beign careless about it is inviting trouble.",negative,restaurant

6120,"After hearing a lot about this place I got a chance to finally visit this. As once reaction was ""Wow"" but that went away pretty soon.
Right from the Entry there was a confusion. We did a booking through Dine Out for 8:30 pm which didn't really make sense as the table were not blocked. To figure this out we have to wait for 20 mins for the manager to come. When asked about the reservation, Manager was totally Rude and said to my wife that ""She should be happy that she got a table"". I mean WOW, it was an eye opener for us.
And at that point I realised this is one of the mostly badly managed places.

No doubt its huge with good lighting , Ambience and Dance floor but the service is pathetic.
The Food is average and costly. Nothing great in drinks. Prices are all on a higher side. 
We just got a drink and a platter and left to a much better managed and a calm place.

There is no point making such a huge place if you cant manage and talk to customers nicely. Not really sure if i would like to visit this place again even though its a hot property right now(now really sure why)",negative,restaurant
3232,"Yesterday we visited this place at 8:30pm. We are 10 people. There was not that much rush in restaurant. If you are going with Zomato gold offer, they will treat as beggar who came to eat without paying any money. Overall very worst experience. Tomato soup with weird smell. We ordered Kung Pao Mahroom as a starter but I can't feel Kunng pao taste in mashroom starter at all. it feels like mashroom chilli. We ordered Baby Corn Masala*2 and Paneer lababadar*2 as Main course and we observed that they served very less quantity compare to other tables as we have zomato gold. They added Baby corn and Paneer pieces which we can easily count. There is more gravy then vegetables, paneer and baby corns as like roadside restaurant usually serve. Even Service is really slow on regular days. I don't know how they manage on weekend. Waiters are very lazy and behaving like they are customers. Best thing is only ambiance.

First, I called them on their number to check if it is open at 6 PM on a Sunday. The person who received call on behave of Prism stated that it is open from 6 PM. Once we reach there by 6:30 PM, no staff was ready to respond and said who told you it is open now. The way they spoke to their customer is really annoying. ""I Don't know to whom you have called and taken the confirmation about the open hours but, as you came early I am considering you and giving a table"". Is this how low they treat a customer? 

Secondly, When requested for a good seat as there is no crowd available. The manager or a person with attitude told us ""No, there are no seats available""(In a bold manner). When I checked from Zomato there are plenty of tables available. I got pinched with irritation. Though, I felt the lighting is good and order for drinks to my friends.

Finally, Me and my friends were feeling uncomfortable with the way people treating their customer. And then, mosquitoes came into picture. There are full of mosquitoes hissing around our heads and of course no AC has turned ON. Out of frustration, we tried cancelling the food that was ordered by us and everything we ordered. They said, it is not possible to cancel the order and your order will be here in 20 minutes. I was like ""WTF"". I asked for cheque and paid the bill without having anything and left the place.

No way to remove them.

I would recommend this place to non vegetarians. Order veg and get non veg for the price of veg!

3429,"As the name suggests, its supposed to be a Marriott and that's what you expect. The reality is very different.

Let's start with my experience even before reaching. I was advised to make a reservation for 2 people almost 3 days ahead to get a good place by the pool. And so I did.
I was denied reservation saying that it's really ""full"" but they finally said they can get me one table. I was happy.

It has a separate entrance in SLN terminus with it's own parking and valet which is real comfortable.
Now let's talk real business.

Upon Reaching I see the place completely empty. Maybe 2 tables were taken and rest were empty. I didn't understand why they had to do play so hard to get. Even by the time we left, the place was hardly even half full. The whole inside area was empty and few tables taken outside.

Ambience : the only thing good about it is the ambience but its not as grand as people suggest. It's very mediocre.

Staff: THE WORST SERVICE EVER. I have had better service in small restaurants or even small Dhabas if I may compare them. I had to call waiting staff for 10 mins for everything and they took their happy time to come. There is an inside seating and outside, we took the inside because it was too noisy out.

I asked one waiter why the service was so bad and he very rudely replied to me ""Andar koi nahi baithta"" (No one sits inside)
If you didnt have plans to serve people inside then why did you keep the damm place open?

There was a buffet and we went for it, now they kept a live counter open in the buffet with no chef there. We had to again wait for the waiting staff to notice us calling them, they then had to go call the chef who again took his jolly time to come and prepare what he was supposed to.

Being a Marriott, you'd expect some decent service they said if I'm paying with card I have to come to the billing counter and pay there. Such behaviour does not warrant prices at par with any 5 star hotel.

Food: There was hair in the food. Starters were okay but main course was very bad. And let me make special note of the dessert.

If I'm coming for a buffet in such a place, I'd expect to have desserts made by them and not bought from the local sweet shop. They bought kaaju kathli, Rasgulla, Some barfi among some cake etc. And no spoons to take them, had to again wait for staff to come give us spoons to take some dessert.

Next to the dessert counter there were dirty clothes kept in plain view. I've attached pictures

After paying when we were leaving someone tried to come and ask us how our evening went. When we tried to Express our grief, that waiter/manager just blatantly shut me off. I'm not paying for you to shut me off when you asked me how it was in the first place.

It was the most disappointing experience I ever had in Hyderabad. Marriott has to get its game straight and take some serious action in this property. I will for sure NEVER come here again and will also not let my friends waste their money here.",negative,restaurant

Reason stated by the staff - if you won’t pay, it will be deducted from our salary.
2. When asked for salad (thrice), no one served. Ultimately, one of us, went to the buffet section and got the onions. Even this wasn’t noticed by anyone.
3. Not happy with the quality of food. Ordered “papdi paneer kebab” as per the staff recommendation. It was dry and not good. We told the guy who served and got no response for our concern.

I have had Mutton Kheema Biriyani earlier from Pista House - Kondapur & Nizampet, both of which were awesome and of the same taste & make, however, the same didn't turn true for Kheema biriyani from the Gachibowli outlet.  All my friends who had the biriyani today shares the same opinion, so, I am not being overly critical at all. I don't understand, how such reputed brands/chain do not maintains consistency of taste & recipe across all the outlets, they do maintain consistency with the prices though..

Not sure, if Pista House would be be even interested to take this comment seriously OR act upon it to get things better for next time, but, at least I request that they don't cheat on their customer's expectations.

What was bad with the biriyani -

1. It was all rice and no kheema
2. This is NOT at all the same recipe that is being served in other outlets (Nizampet & Kondapur)
3. Trivial though - but the packaging is also inconsistent as compared to other outlets ( while other outlets packs in Container , Pista House - Gachibowli deliver in foil packet )

One has to pay for packaging only. Big packaging and less quantity. One should never order from Behroz biryani. Do not go with their briyani picturs shown on website in reality its only rice packed in some big attractive boxesNever try biryani here , However we were shocked to find just one piece of mutton in the Biryani. Not sure how Behrouz expected us to consume the box full of rice with a small piece of mutton. We have decided not to order anymore from this restaurant. worst of a kind and never tasted such filthy biryani in my life , and secondly they are charging bomb price for such filthy biryani ie 379

The Zomato gold benefits were denied as the Asian cuisine menu was from the other restaurant of the same owner which was not told to us before we ordered.

The grill was replaced and hot starters were served so the point of the grill was totally made redundant. As soon as we pointed out that the service was slow and the starters weren't coming quickly, we dint know what we were calling for. The waiters visited our table every 2-3 mins to enquire if everything is alright now. I am not exaggerating when I say that they came to me at least 20-25 times in the next one hour to let them know that they are doing good. I did not dare to say that they weren't still good with the service and starters we were asking were not coming. They almost forced us to say they were excellent as apparently the rating for them was important even if it meant disturbing us every odd minute and spoiling the whole meal. Finally I was forced to give them an excellent rating as the man stood next to me till I did that. Feedback is to improve and not to be used as a tool torture. The food was nevertheless mediocre except the mutton sheek kabab and chicken pepper soup which was good.

The only good thing i can remember is Aaloo tiki chaat.

I would recommend you to plan somewhere, even if it's a team dinner, though mine was not!

It's not even worth ₹ 500 and i am definitely not going to Sheraton again!",negative,restaurant

I anyway don't eat Dominos pizza given some pretty bad prior experience. But ordered on my wife's insistence. Congratulations. Now even my wife doesn't want to order Dominos ever again. :)

1. Zomato doesn't have any view on what the restaurant is doing with the order. The system automatically said food is being prepared when clearly the restaurant has no clue on the order.

I was shocked when I received a message from traffic police about challan which was issued on 15th Apr 2019 for traffic violation. In fact, it is very impractical, and owner should educate to security not to provide any wrong information. If restaurant does not have valet parking, then the customer has the responsibility to park her or his car.

With situation, I have no choice so I have paid the amount of challan, but would like to share my experience for awareness to others so individual can take care while parking their car based on valet parking.

But this manager asked 2k cover charge from us, and we saw, he did same with another three guys group.
We didn’t make any nuisance there, and silently left the place.
So , tell me Club Rogue why this discrimination?

They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve.

Old review:
                         This place was on my bookmark list for a while and I was excited to visit it on Saturday. We ordered a mushroom quiche, a primavera pizza and a grilled vegetable panini.The mushroom quiche was alright but what knocked me out was the price. It was a relatively small piece with a spoon of caramalized onions and a small amount of onions and salad and they charge 150 rupees for that. The pizza was about 9 inches and tasted alright. But its a whopping 500 rupees. The grilled panini is pretty much the same.I know the restaurant is all about european cuisine but they dont have to make their prices european as well. I had pizzas or quiche that tasted a lot better at a cheaper price. Dont get me wrong the food isnt horrible but its alright. But it does feel bitter after you pay the bill lol",negative,restaurant
7035,"This place is nothing as it is shown in the images. The ambience maybe good, but the service is too bad. The chicken salt and pepper was nothing as simple as I thought and the tai pei crispy chicken was not all crisp. And if this was not enough the add on was the main course. The name mentioned in the menu for the main course resembles more of a continental food, which creates a lot of confusion. We ordered three dishes for main course not having any about the fact that the dishes are gravies, rather than semi gravy. The worst is the suggestions from the manager, who suggested us to have a rice item along with the dishes we ordered. Knowing that the dishes comes with gravy and it would be too much for 3 people to have that much gravy, it was very disappointing to have a suggestion from them. Moreover despite of showing the Zomato gold coupon the code was not added and even after having such a bad experience and complaining about the food, they added an extra service charge to the final bill. Won't complain much about the ambience but the food menu is a bit confusing.
My suggestion would be if you already had a drink or too its better not to order without asking, and importantly don't try and take suggestion from the management.
Been to many Asian restaurants, had bad food, but never got so confused about the menu. I had Sandip Acharyya with me. Both of us are very dissapointed.

The first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor. The chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place. You find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients, scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around. Another unique practice I noticed was that, while the waiter serves you the starters, he is constantly touching the serving spoons/tongs to the half eaten food in your plate. Then you find him serving the same starters to the next table.
The place is chaotic, with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters. The main course buffet has limited choices too.

3030,"*Writing this review as soon as I got out of the restaurant*
From the beginning itself the restaurant caught my bad impression and bad experience. Left right after starters. I wouldn't even care to rate it one star. One of worst restaurants to dine-in. I think it'll be good experience for corporate lunches or dinners because the more the people the more the💰💰💰
After reaching at 2 PM there was no receptionist. After the receptionist finally came they made us wait for more than 20 minutes to find and set up the table for just 2 people. It was very clear that the tables just needed plates to be arranged. That's it. A piece of advise to y'all: if you see any restaurant taking this long without any valid reason then please get outta there. Neither proper AC chambers nor proper cooling. It was HOT. Thanks POT POURRI for understanding and making our dining uncomfortable😒. After we sat they took extremely long time and then cared to ask if we're opting for veg or non-veg. By this time I was already wondering if they thought we're idiots and they can just make us wait and treat however they want, I just realised that it was true.
After soup and buttermilk starters were served PAINFULLY SLOW. It took MORE THAN AN HOUR FOR THEM TO FINISH SERVING JUST 6 STARTERS. Were they kidding me?? They wasted my precious time and this isn't what a customer wants. If you can't give importance to our time then we better eat elsewhere. We had to school the waiters regarding their service, then we spoke to their leader(I guess) and he also gave the same old typical answer ""sorry. I'll just get that served for you"". We don't want no sorry. You can't placate us with sorry for our time, hard work and money spent. After seeing no improvement we finally had to speak to the manager as listen to ""sorrys"". I decided to leave the restaurant. After all this HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO CHARGE US THE COMPLETE BILL. It was 1100. It wasn't even worth it even if we had the whole menu. After arguing he decided to give 10% discount which in his case made a hole in his pocket as as if it would make it up for the experience we had😒. Wouldn't suggest nor would even like to think about this restaurant.
Starters: I found the starters to be normal good in quality. Not very impressive nor was menu standing out. If you pay 100-200 more you'll be getting much better restaurant in many aspects especially in terms of food.
1. Soup: we were served chicken soup. It wasn't impressive. It was fine.
2. Buttermilk under drinks: it was tasty.
3. Chicken tikka: it was ok. It was hard, sometimes soft.
4. Ajwani paneer tikka: it was very good in taste.
5. Kodi vepudu: it was chicken with common known marination. I mean it felt like typical Indian curry. It was just good.
6. Fried veg green chilli: it was just ok in taste. Couldn't make out if it's actually chilly.
7. Corn fried fish: it was fish coated with corn flakes which was giving nice honey taste. Probably this is the only best thing there.
8. Crispy corn: corn was crispy as expected and tasted good.
Main course: I found it to be typically common. Nothing new if you've been to buffets before.
Accompaniments were regular papad, curd, naan, roti.
Desserts: not much varieties. What's there is menu is served.
Ambience: I don't care about ambience as long as food is good and my patience isn't tested.",negative,restaurant

5207,"Having heard a lot about this place (specially their Triveni biryani) I came here once and ordered food 3-4 times)

The last time I purchased food here would actually be the last time I would eat from here.

This restaurant is a classic example of how it started on a grand note and ended up being just another restaurant with hygiene issues.

To cut the long chase short, I had purchased 2 items. 1 paneer tikka biryani and Bhimwaram pulav (take aways)

In spite of telling them, both items were very spicy. My wife and I were struggling with the food. Now to top it, I found a flying insect (not a cockroach but something else with wings) that got cooked with the paneer tikka biryani.

Alas, that was so repulsive that I left the food mid way and satiated my hunger with curd rice

I'm never going back to them",negative,restaurant

Then we moved to Hyderabad, FMW followed.
We were so happy, to have a Goan restaurant just 5 min drive from home.
In the beginning it was great place to dine. Then it started getting local. Fishes started getting stale, fewer varieties ..Not so great.
Now , after about 3 years, it's more a typical curry point.
We ordered Mutton Xacuti and Kingfish Richado.
Fish was so firm and overcooked, richado overloaded with sweetness.
Mutton was out of the world, with heaps of Curry leaves(Kadi patta/Karia paku) , super high on heat....Reminded me of a Rayala curry in Dindi (Godavari distt ). Meat was cooked with extra affection that it took me 5 min to chew it like a bubblegum. I really thank myself for not ordering more.

Food was pathetic as well. Tanduri roti that we ordered was made of maida. And the dishes were either too oily or just bad.

3140,"Went for a team lunch. The place is opposite Care Hospital.

Ambiance

This place has normal ambiance as all the other Irani hotels. The problem is that there are a lot of Swiggy delivery boys and they waiting outside the door to collect their parcels. We felt bad sitting there while they were peering inside in the hot sun and us eating there.

Food quality

We ordered three items

1. Devils Chicken
: Chewy chicken coated. This was the best dish of the lot

2. Tandoori Chicken
: fully burnt, coated with ghee to hide the bad quality

3. Premium Biryani: This was really bad. When people go to a Irani style hotel, there are some expectations. We like Biriyani dum cooked. This particular Biriyani costed 650 and came in a slightly large bowl. Please be careful as this can only serve 3 people. The Rice was passable and the Biriyani was fully mixed..... Not the layering like it is supposed to be. It textured like a pulao with the masala . The chicken manchuri in it was cold and the coating had fallen off... You can tell that is was stale. The Chicken pieces were only bones. the mutton pieces were not existent.

This looks like a outlet which is run by fake people.

Biryani and food items in traditional hotels like Paradise, Shah Ghouse, Mehfil, Shahdab, Bawarchi are really good. The tandoori chicken will normally be crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.

The service took a long time in coming. It looks like they are short of staff. People will go there by the name and feel bad. I feel the Pista house owners should look into quality and quantity issues. This outlet is making a fast buck in the Hitech area where floating population is heavy.",negative,restaurant

Service is good too. This place mentions the % of alcohol content for every drink. Anyone who wants to try to have alcohol for the first time this place is of course a good start of it.

I would recommend non vegetarians to go to this place because I don't find veg tasty here..! But thankfully I am a pure non vegetarian..!!",neutral,restaurant
371,"To sum it up - ""Amazingly Delicious"".

We ordered the enormous Tandoori Family Platter, fresh Apollo fish and the massive ""Jumbo Pack"" Biryani.

Tandoori Family Platter (hand for scale) - This beast consist of 5 whole chickens (different kebabs), boti kebabs and seekh kebabs ... Served with 8 rumali rotis
and
Apollo Fish (The plate in top middle which is not so small but looks tiny in front of the platter)

Jumbo Pack Biryani - This delicious biryani is the one to die for. Arguably, one of the best Hyderabadi Biryani, it is served with Egg curry & raita and can easily feed an entire family.

Price:
Tandoori Family Platter: Rs. 1300/-
Apollo Fish: Rs. 240/-
Jumbo Pack Biryani: Rs.600/-

Food : 4.5/5
Service : 4/5

Probably he has seen a different sample size :) But this is a nice Chinese place serving both buffet and a la carte. Do try their Ginger Fried Rice and Chilli Garlic Noodles.

From vegetarian heart shaped nutella pancakes to a classic English breakfast with omelettes and hash browns they’ve got it all.

They also have a dine-in available if you wish to drop by. Not to mention the place also whips up some amazing shawarma and rice combos.

Juices to coffee, they’ve got everything you need. All this without burning a hole in your pocket.

In picture:

I had ordered their Nutella Pancakes and coffee: the packaging was perfect and the Nutella was well smothered. The coffee hadn’t leaked either.
While the pancakes were true to being eggless the baking soda/powder was slightly overpowering. But still manages to be one of the best eggless pancakes joint for me.",neutral,restaurant

Chose this over some top restaurants at SLN Terminus and I must say I wasn't disappointed.

The buffet has a simple menu with nearly 20 items. Food tasted decent but the desserts should be improved by miles as they create final impressions in any buffet.

Ambiance is quite good with Indoor and Outdoor seating, the place was fully packed on a Weekday afternoon.
It has 2 screens and 5 TVs for sports viewing 👍

Service could've been better, the staff seemed quite confused and unresponsive sometimes.

Was really happy to dine at this hidden gem. Ordered Paya shorba which was deliciously made. Succulent paya with equally tasty shorba. For starters we ordered murgh ke Sholay, Phuket fish, rounakhi sheekh kebabs. Every item was a revelation. Gr8 care had been given to maintain the authenticity of each item. For mains we ordered chelo kebab and murgh musallam. Chelo kebab was presented with chicken kebab, and sheekh kebab with tasty ruce. It being a Persian dish, rice was little bland which was complemented perfectly by the combination of both the kebabs. Perfect. And the murgh musallam was as perfect as it could be.

I was in mood for chinese and went full blast.
The wonton soup superceded the manchow one.
The dragon prawns were okayish. The sangdown chicken wings could have been more jucier.

Coming on to the main course, we had ordered a barrage of items.
Sanghai fried rice: loved it
Kung pao chicken : delicious
Hunan chicken : bland, had to parcel
Shrimp soft noodles: good
Bamboo fried rice: good
Pan fried noodles in Cantonese sauce: a disaster.

For my part I had ordered food which turned out to be best, my friends were dissapointed.

The mojito and virgin mojito were good and packed a punch.

2748,"Not worth it at all. Paid 500₹ just to end up eating curd rice for the night .

Went here last night, got a table for 3.
The service was extremely poor and slow .
The waiter.. brought ""warm"" water bottle on a summer day .. first dropped water on us while pouring water into glass .. asked for cold water .. he came back only after 3 reminders.
He was the only one around .. wearing a CSK T shirt.

When the starters started arriving I was shocked
The starters were extremely spicy and contained extreme amounts of garlic. Un bearable.
For a person who has stayed in Hyderabad all my life .. the waiter gives an explanation that this is how Hyderabadi food tastes.

Mushroom wasn't good ..spicy and nothing less.
Fish wasn't cooked
Chicken was toooo spicy
Crispy corn .. basic item.. was oily and under cooked.
Potato Cooked with its skin was again oily and totally bad

Panner didn't arrive at all

Water arrived

Left all food as it is on the plate and went got main course...
Biryani tasted like a spicy pulihora

Settled for curd rice

Icecream- asked for a butterscotch icecream with some ""gems""
Icecream was good but The gems were tasting like synthetic chocolate.. horrible .. had to spit in the plate and leave in a hurry

When I was about to leave the panner starter arrived .. I had a bite .. it was ok

But I had enough already

Everyone around my table were complaining too..
But no use ..
Useless place

201,"Here is one of the best buffet places for team lunch in Gachibowli area. This colourful place is so hospitable that you will just go muahhhh...

Ambience is quite good and has optimum free space. This place seems to be set up for team lunches only 😂. The menu present is splendid and too many items are there that you won't be able to taste each and every item(I don't even remember all the names!!!!

Starters are mouth watering (as I write), may it be veg or non veg. To begin, start with chaat counter which has a conveyor belt with plates arranged on it, this section includes sushi, golgappa, aamras shot, etc. This is self served so stop being lazy and go satiate your mouth watering taste buds!!

Delicious Starters are served on your table. The one of the attraction is the pizza oven!! You can be your own chef and try making a pizza of your choice and yeah you also get a Master Chef Certificate 😛( Hoping you may use it in your resume). Main course also has some delicacies worth trying. I am not naming any because I was having foodgasm that I hardly cared to read names.

Desserts ahhahahhhaa!!!
You have good number of options of pastries and ice creams and indian sweets. I had gulaab jamun, halwa, pastries and Pan Ice cream(which is highly praised here)!!!

The ice creams are instantly prepared using liquid nitrogen and is a treat to watch. You will also find hot jalebis and etc etc etc.

Only drawback is that during high incoming rush, staff is in a hurry and you can't have much leisure time!!!

I would suggest go and give it a try with your team or gang... I believe that you won't regret trying this fabulous place!!!

Sauce was mayo and red sauce. I am not sure how ppl eat mayo with momos? Antways i tried the red sauce , thinking that sauce may help with thick coating and oil, sauce was realy confusing zero taste just sodium thats it!

It was drop dead gorgeous view from there and the weather was cold with chill winds so we had to put our jackets back on. But on a regular evening, the place would be warm. They have been serving us some nice cocktails and some punchy mocktails like chatpata masala.
.
The starters were not that great and needs much improvement. They had chicken manchow soup, and coriander soup which were really bleak and the place won’t be expecting much orders on them as it’s a bar. The Hyderabadi Tawa Fish was exceptionally great and turned out to be my favourite of the night. In the vegetarian department I’ll recommend Tandoori Broccoli 🥦.

Further to the main course the Tangadi kebab was perfectly cooked juicy chicken legs. The masalas of Cashew nut chicken and chicken tikka were soo tasty. They were an amazing combination with the rotis. The place has improve a lot on a handful of starters and rest will be taken care of.

I went here with my team on Friday night and booked upper deck for the same. The place no doubt is very spacious and has one of the best dance floors in Hyderabad. The light system and other props were good. It reminded me of Club Octagon in Gangnam, Seoul. Overall ambience is good with 2 levels of seating where ground floor can is suitable for small groups or couples and upper deck has sofa sets for bigger groups.

Food is just average here. Starters like paneer tikka, baby corn or chicken tikka were very greasy. Main course was also not upto the mark.

Worst thing I experienced about this place is the service.
I asked person attending us to start the main course at 8.30 pm. To which he replied it will take another half an hour to get the main course ready. It would have been fine if main course got started at the said time but after many more follow ups it started at 10 pm !! This really pissed me off and ruined whole experience.

But were sad to know that it wasn't available. Service was the best over all things said above! Mr Sarveshwar was quick to all our requests being made and had great suggestions to give! The sole reason why this review has a 4 rating instead of a 3 or 3.5. Only thing a lil lull about the experience was that they had stopped the music midway. So, that dropped our moods and spirits a lil! Wish the restaurant had it going till the end!

Food - The name itself will get any Hyderabadis taste buds jiggle! And certainly it stood up to it's name, the food here was delectable!

I'll list out my favorites first, In the starters I just fell in love with the Murgh Kalmi Kebab, chicken leg pieces marinated in not so spicy mixture, it was delicious and it is a #musttry on my list! I jumped ahead a lil without mentioning the soup because murgh kalmi was magical, likewise Yakhni Shorba (Indianized Mutton Soup) was a great way to get things started! It had the perfect balance of flavours and that subtle amount black pepper does a great job! Sabz Ki Shaami, a mashed vegetable mixture, fried in oil, served with mayonnaise and mint chutney was a good light vegetarian starter. Paneer Achari Kebab wasn't the softest and also the sides were burnt a lil so they need to work on this, otherwise the flavor is pretty good! Gosht Sheekh Kebab, a classic, the salt levels were perfect and the meat was really tender, felt it was a bit dry though. Patrani Fish, wrapped inside a banana (I'm guessing) leaf, was topped with a layer of mint chutney, although the fish was heavenly, I'd love it to be served without the layering of the chutney! Tandoori Jhinga was again beautifully done and it is the second #musttry starter!

The drinks got mixed reactions! Well 60% of them being below average and another 40% being extraordinary, it was a rollercoaster in this dept.! We gave the review to the management regarding the basic ones and soon after that they presented us Cinderella, Caramel Mint Mojito and Mint Cooler which just blew us all away! I hope they maintain the same consistency in other mocktails as well!

The main course had us dying! We were already so full and there was plenty of food left! Gosht Achari, Murgh Achari, the former being a lil more spicier, were just classic dishes being served and when you combine them with nicely done butter naans, there's nothing better than this combination! Nargisi Kofta was another curry, couldn't differentiate much when compared to the other two.

Special mention goes to 'Sikendari Raan' for ₹1490, it was a treat to watch this magnificent charred leg piece of a lamb on a plate with oozing juices and scrumptious sides! If you're a lamb lover then it is something that'll satisfy all your Mutton cravings! Food gets a solid 10/10! Need to work on the drinks though!

Ambiance - It is a huge property just opposite to SLN Terminus. With ground and first floor seating, it has plenty of space to fill in atleast 130 people at once! Although the place is well lit, I didn't feel anything special being around because right now and always theme based restaurants will give more customer satisfaction rather than just a clean well lit place with good furniture! 'Hyderabadi Daawat' should incorporate anything and everything Hyderabad has to offer in it's culture as nobody else in that area are doing that! I had crazy ideas like making the waiters wear a classic Lungi, have Marfa (Hyderabadi Band Baaja) outside on the weekends, but the classy interiors just don't allow this to happen! Well you never know, I'm not saying that place is bad but they have to add an element of joy! Ambiance gets 8/10!

Service - It was decent! As they're pretty fresh in the market, they'll have to work rigorously to improvise according to the customers taste! The food arrived in an ample time and the table was being cleared every now and then! I'd like every person around to know each and every dish on the menu because due to the unusual names the crowd there will feel disconnected and not know what to order! The waiters, butlers need to push the specials everyday rather than just leaving it on the vast menu they have! Overall service gets 8/10!

I ordered veg cheesy melt paneer wrap and paneer Tikka wrap. They also served tikha masala with wrap..Those who love spicy food must like this masala...

Cheesy melt paneer wrap was outstanding...Cheese was busting in mouth with each bite..paneer and gravy was really tasty..It has Punjabi flavor with cheese combination..Loved it..

Paneer wrap - It was average in taste as the gravy was little bland and plus it has cheakpea curry which annoyed me a lot.. taste was not good..

We had grilled chicken, butter chicken, butter naan, rumali roti and chicken biryani. I like their chutney which comes with chicken. Biryani was nice but little spicy.

The items on the buffet were so limited that I hardly had anything to eat. Multi-Cuisines (On the website: Continental, Italian, North Indian, Chinese, Asian, Thai), but in reality only continental and Asian.

That too without a chicken starter in the continental department and the Fish served was so salty that it was not at all eatable. Not even a single Indian item was found in the entire menu.

I am here for a lunch buffet but alas, wasnt what I was expecting. Starters Pathetic !
The prawn is okaish, apart from that everything stands to be a disaster. Uncooked Chicken Malai kababs to kabab mei "" huddi"" (bone).
Beware of the dirty, stinky and glue piece of cloth napkin!!

Soup served was a shorba which tasted masala warm water. The mocktail tasted really good. Finally !!

Coming to the main course I am not putting up any pictures as they were average ! Trust me nothing special !!

The taste was something that will crave you to have more and more even when you are full!!!
I visited this place with my friend without any proper planning.. our intention was to visit the pub in the same mall but we were too hungry and were not interested in eating in pub!! We wanted something heavy to get that energy to dance like crazy 💃💃

🔴We ordered the Punjabi Special VegThali:
₹269/-
It was the most delicious Thali I ever had in life, just divine and out of the world ❤️❤️
It comprises of the following:
▪️Kadai Paneer (4.5/5)
Paneer are usually always tasty in most of the restaurants but the gravy always lacks the taste!! I have the habit of just eating the paneer cubes and leaving the gravy!!! But, this one has the most tasty and delicious gravy👍👍

▪️Dum aloo (4/5)
This was the veg of the day, potatoes 🥔 were peeled properly and were marinated nicely!!! Just like paneer, the gravy was something to lure for!!

▪️Dal Makhani (4.5/5)
A Punjabi Thali is definitely incomplete without a Dal Makhani!!! It is one of the most popular and loved dal in the northern part of the country!! The dal gets its taste and richness from the use of cream and butter in black lentils and red kidney beans!! It was super yummy and definitely the best dal makhani I ever had!!

▪️Bundi Raita (5/5)
This one stole my heart ❣ I think words won’t do justice for its great taste!! I never had such a tasty raita ever in any restaurant and trust me I eat out a lot!!! I would have mind having 3 bowls of raita at one go coz it was this yummy!! The curd was fresh and the minimum spices used in it was adding the perfect flavour... A big thumbs up for this dish 👍👍👍

▪️Rice (4/5)
The zeera basmati rice 🍚 was definitely of the best quality!! It was big in size and was cooked so well!! Each rice piece was looking like a gem on its own !!!

▪️Butter Tandoori Roti (4/5)
It was soft, buttery and definitely only made up of wheat 🌾 without any hint of maida!!!

▪️Salad (4.5/5)
Fresh cucumber 🥒, carrot 🥕 and onion with a pinch of lemon 🍋 is definitely makes the best salad in a Punjabi Thali 👍👍

▪️Kheer (4/5)
The perfect way to end a meal is by having a sweet dish and what can be better than kheer!!! It was not overly sweet but the sugar was mixed in a way that will suit everyone!!!
.
.
⚫️ The service was quick and they did not made us wait for more than 15 mins!!! What I like most about the food was that the spices was added in a perfect way, just to make it tasty they have not turned it into super spicy!!!
The quantity is good for one person although even two person can share it!!! But, I will suggest not to share as it is so yummy and tasty, you will regret sharing even a single bite!!
Surely try this outlet and you will thank me later ❤️❤️

Biryani and more, a new outlet in Gachibowli is fine-dine restaurant.
It has recently opened and serves varieties of biryani and other food dishes.
This restaurant is on the ground floor and can be easily spotted by the crowd passing by the road.
I’ve been here for a dinner session.
The ambience of this place is quite good with bright lights all over the place.
It was a weekend and there was a pretty good amount of crowd at that time.
We started with mocktails.
They had many varieties of mocktails,out which we ordered the sparkling blue,ginger cola,mango lassi,ginger lemon and ginger mojito.
All the mocktails were of different colours making them very appealing for us to drink.
Almost all the mocktails had mint,lemon and ice which was refreshing!
The mango lassi was too sweet.
Then we were served with soups,
Veg lemon coriander soup
Chicken manchow soup
The veg lemon coriander soup was served hot with parboiled broccoli.
The chicken manchow soup was full of flavour and was served with crispy fried noodles,it tasted delicious.
We were then served with starters,
Apollo fish:
The fish was well cooked and soft but had so much of salt in it.
Tender chicken:
This was something very tasty,the chicken was soft,tender and with good amount of spice.
Bangla kodi:
It is one of the most popular dishes,it was crispy,light and was well presented with coriander garnish.
The chilli prawns:
The prawns were juicy,spicy and had great flavour.
Crispy veg and corn 65 were other vegetarian starters which we had.
They also were good but not that great.
Next we were served with main course:
They served us different types of curry’s with Indian breads.
The chicken chetinadu,its a spicy chicken curry which was too good.
The other curry’s were chicken tikka masala,tomato cashew nut and ulvacharu chicken.
The ulvacharu chicken,a chicken curry with horse gram soup was outstanding and finger licking good.

Biryanis:
We were then served biryani.
avakai chicken biryani
Afghani chicken biryani

Avakai chicken biryani is a authentic Andhra dish,it had a wonderful taste still haunting.
Afghani chicken biryani is very different from other biryani,it had unique flavour.
It was served with egg omelet above the biryani .
We ended up our meal with deserts,
Qubani ka meetha,gulab jamun and junnu.
The deserts were not that great and had disappointed me.
Overall the restaurant has good biryani’s and I would suggest everyone to visit this place especially for avakai chicken biryani.

Teppan soba noodles, a sizzler, is just as good. All in all, a happy experience!

I have not had such soft and delicious todu in a long time and was happy to have given that a shot. Moreover, the portion size was fairly decent.

Ambiance- 
Olive Garden is located at the Time Square, Indira Nagar beside Dominos Pizza. There is nothing much to say about the ambiance of Olive Garden Restaurant. This restaurant is very small, with no live screening and no music. Ambiance is quite boring, as they didn't even decorated it much. Even on the Saturday night, this place was not at all crowded.
Food-
We ordered Chicken Chatpati Kebab as a starter cost approximately INR 255. The quantity of Kebab was very less. They served Kebab with the green Pudina Chutney. Both the qauntity and the quality was not upto the expectations. Then we ordered Chicken Dum Biryani cost approximately INR 210.
This was the worst dum biryani I ever had, that I didn't even tasted like Biryani. Instead of Dum, they added so much oil in that Biryani. Olive Garden offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership.

Went to celebrate my bday today..It was the worst food buffet I ever had in any above average costly restaurant.They charge so high for this shitty buffet.

1. Ambience- Even a local resaturant also have some areas of decoration in their restaurant but they have it like a messy hall. No theme no decoration
2. Service- No serving of starters, no serving of even water until u ask,no serving of even sauce at your table and waters think themself like heroes here.
3. Food- The worst part of it..Some stale starters of chicken and fish. Veg ones you cant even chew corn items as they might be few days old.One chicken starter only had some taste. Main course is also pretty below average.Pasta is good.Pizza(so called best Hyderabadi pizza) was worse than a 50rs local shop pizza.
Deserts- they put some sweets of local shops as deserts.
Two juices as welcome drinks were Ok.

I gave two stars rating because manager politely listened to all my complaints on food ambience and all and gave a delicous pudding cake to celebrate my bday.Thanks for that.

For starters ordered Tandoori murgh Adraki, it was served hot and really delightful. The taste was awesome and chicken was properly tandoored. In the same course we ordered the usual tandoori roti and Murg tikka lababdar. Murg tikka was awesome, it was not too spicy nor too blunt, it was perfect gravy with boneless chicken.

Only word of advice for the management is PLEASE STOP APPLYING GST ON PRODUCTS SOLD AT MRP SUCH AS COLD DRINKS AND WATER BOTTLES. GST should not be calculated on those products.

9309,"Couldn't resist posting this review. Has been visiting this place since the time it opened - has been there multiple times. Never before felt this urge of posting a review since the food always stood out and dominated the service.

But nothing changed over the time in terms of service, rather it's turned worse over time. There can't be an excuse of quality of food in exchange of service. If food is the only yardstick, they fail to beat that as well. Dishes are pretty authentic but equally monotonous in taste.

As a customer, I would rather not visit to wait for two ordered dishes for an hour. Worse food that can be had sooner is always better than slightly better food with infinitely worse service.",neutral,restaurant

6336,"It was a date with my girls who wanted to eat Chinese so we decided to go to Dine O China for the simple reason that it is close to home and it turned out that we chose a super place to have Chinese.
The restaurant is located in Gachibowli and is easy to drive to from ORR and has a proper basement parking so no issues even on the busy Gachibowli road; for me it is a major point of concern if I am driving on my own so at least parking was sorted.
We entered the restaurant and were warmly welcomed by a stewardess who took down our order and served us. It felt like by the women for the women. It felt comfortable that is all.
The seating arrangement is quite comfortable and I particularly liked the chairs as they were so comfortable. We ordered chicken drumsticks and honey chilli potato for starters and both the dishes were awesome. Kids liked the chicken drumsticks and finished the plate. They were juicy and done to perfection and my girls told me that they were fresh also. Honey chilli potato was crunchy and sweet and chilly just like it should be.
For our main course we ordered veg dimsums and chicken dimsums and mix Chinese chopsuey. Both the dimsums were tasty and the wrapping was quite thin so you could taste the filling which was quite substantial. But I would recommend that you have dimsums with the sauce that they serve with honey chilly potato. I find it tastes better with this chilly sauce rather than the sauce that they serve with dimsums.
The mix Chinese chopsuey has a mix of egg, chicken and seafood and the girls told me that they liked the taste of it.
For dessert we tried chocolate fried ice cream which can be given a pass as I didn't like it that much.
Infact we liked the food so much that we got chilli garlic noodles packed for dinner also. And also the girls could not finish the chopsuey so we got it packed and will now have it in dinner.
We liked the place very much and once the husband gets back to Hyderabad we are visiting this place again for sure.

Pity Zomato doesn't give me chance to review the place on my second visit. Like I mentioned we would come back to this place we went there yesterday afternoon for some snacks and got some dinner packed for ourselves. We tried chilli garlic fish, kids' favourite chicken drumsticks again, chicken satay and lemon chicken coriander soup and veg talumein soup. All of which was great.
We asked for crispy chilly baby corn which turned out to be too salty and on complaining the stewardess served us a fresh batch which was quite tasty.
Definitely a must visit place. Will be back again when I am craving for some yummy Chinese food.

7064,"This restaurant space in Gachibowi is the fusion of Urban Asia and Eat India Company which are under the same roof with different names.

✓Ambience

This is very much spacious having multiple separated halls for group dining with cozy ambience. This restaurant is themed with village style vintage wooden decors all-around the place. Most of the interior walls are covered with vintage wooden doors, windows and locks.

And also there is a separate dining hall where one of the wall is completely covered with photo frames of old nizami Kings and their belongings.

✓Food

We went here for a dinner buffet. The food is really delicious and this was the first time I was liking Sea food in the starters. All the starters are really good but Kung Pao fish and Prawns parsely dry are the best of its kind.

Dinner Buffer Menu:

*Starters:

1. Murgh Haryali Tikka
2. Lahsooni Murgh Tikka
3. Kung Pao Fish
4. Prawns Parsely dry
5. Crispy Potato Corn cube
6. Sichuan Baby Corn
7. Paneer Angar Tikka
8. Corn Tikka
9. French fries

*Main Course:

1. Bindi Jai Puri
2. Yellow Dal Tadka
3. Palak Paneer
4. Murgh Lababdar
5. Mutton do Pyaza
6. Murgh Dum biryani
7. Sabzi Dum biryani
8. Garlic noodles
9. Butter Naan and Roti
10. Curd Rice
11. Khow suey

*Salads:

1. Tossed Salad
2. Crispy Noodles Salad
3. Kimchi Salad
4. Grilled chicken salad

*Desserts:

1. Pineapple Tarts
2. Chocolate Brownie
3. Pastries
4. Shahi Tukda
5. Varied flavors of ice creams.

We don't have much variety in desserts but the ice creams here are really good and served with different luscious toppings. Just looking at them will trigger the cravings in your mouth.

✓Service

The only saddest part of this restaurant is the service that they provide. Though it is a buffet, All the starters will served to the table. There is a lot much interval from one starter to the other starter that they serve.

And you will feel that half the time your plate is empty and you need to keep on waiting for them to serve. The service part of this restaurant is really irritating and this needs to be corrected with much importance.

✓Value for money

The dinner buffet here costs around Rs.650/- per person. And you will definitely feel that this place is worth your money. Be prepared to bear with the bad service and rest you will definitely enjoy. Have a great dining and good day😊",neutral,restaurant

Service is faster compared to many other pubs in the neighborhood even though it's jam packed on a Friday night. They also have a separate section of seating for those who wish to sit and talk serious business, away from the music. The entire hotel which is on the 10th floor has got a royal and classy look.
Staff are courteous and know their menu well. Do ask them for suggestions if you're confused on which ones to choose.
It's got a separate dance floor and Bollywood on the clock after 11 is awesome! They play these retro vibes which all the 90s born adults would love!
Overall it's one of the best I've visited in a long time, will definitely be on my frequent visit list.

I happened to visit this place yesterday for dinner. Well who doesn't like chicken wings? I love wings so wanted to check out this place.
It's a small cozy place, giving cafe feels. Interiors are decent and so is the seating. There aren't any sections as the place is streched longitudinaly. They have self service system.
Coming to food and menu,
The menu looks quite economical with respect to the portion size of the food and taste. So it is value for money. The only thing which needs improvement is the presentation of the dishes.
Taste, quantity and price are all up to the mark.
I tried their signature sauces for the mains, texas bbq, Pattaya thai, spicy garlic, original hot, Mexican jerk and Amazon wild. To my surprise all the wings were delicious specially the bbq and original hot, loved them.
Tried out the chicken nuggets and popcorn chicken... Among which nuggets were really good but chicken popcorn needs some improvement.
The menu seems interesting as they also serve biryani, not the authentic one but related to their respective genre, like wings dum biryani and drumsticks dum biryani. The quantity of chicken in the biryani was heavy and it tasted good too. Also had the chef special gongura chicken which was not on the menu. It was the star of the evening though, tatse, texture everything was perfect.
Also had a ceaser salad which required more dressing and flavour. Had fried chicken burger too, which was tasty and ya tastier than the KFC burger.
Overall the place is affordable and nice. The hospitality was very nice. Thanks Mr. Srinivas, you were always up your feet and served us well. The staff is humble and friendly.

886,"Hyper Local is situated in one such building which has various lounges and pubs. Despite that it has a reputed name and hype.
The place is widely spread evenly with three sections. Two sections on the inside and one section in the outer rooftop area.
The first inside section is inspired by the retro style whereas the other section is nearer to the bar. The two sections are contrasting with each other. The bar area is lighted up and you can grab your drink from there and even enjoying the bartender or the barmaid making your drink.
Hyper Local has introduced the trending ""Drunch"", a sundowner party on Sundays from 3pm to 7pm.
It includes unlimited food and drinks in Rs 1200/_.
The food for the drunch has a selected menu which comprises of starters, main course and dessert.
The drinks menu is wide though and has classic presentations.
Coming to food.... The menu is inspired from the Delhi region thus has the typical Delhi Street Style starters like Gol Gappe, Papdi Chaat, Matar Kulche,
Chole Bhature, and Dahi Vade.
The main course has a subtle style including Thai red curry, noodles, rice, chicken pockets, chicken tikka.
Dessert had the yummiest chocolate pastry which was very soft and yumm.
Drinks were amazing here. My personal favourite was Pina Colada, Fall Alert and Sangria wine from the menu.
Hyper Local is also streaming Live IPL matches so its a perfect blend of enjoying the match with food and drinks at your service at a place with lit Ambience.

Ambiance: Well it's Radisson, so the place looks amazing and one side has huge windows that overlook the gachibowli road. On the opposite is a nice glass wall with water running over it. The spread is at the end with the soups on one side veg and non-veg starters on one side and main course on the other side. Live chat, breads and ice-cream counters on the side. There are beautiful chandeliers and the lighting. The place looks really good.

Food: First of all the spread was amazing. We had veg and non-veg soups, lots of breads - naan, roti, kulchas. Veg starters included paneer tikka, potatoes, veg mix fried. Non-veg included couple of chicken items and fish. The fish was really good and I enjoyed the chicken starters especially the peri peri chicken. 

In main course we had lamb stew, jamaican jerk chicken, kung pao fish and another fish item with coconut rice, steamed rice, noodles with veg and non-veg biryani. For vegetarians we had paneer tikka masala, dal, baked veggies and few other options. The best item was the jerk chicken followed by the kung pao. I also tried the samosa chat which was quite good.

Finally came the desserts. There were cakes, halwa, macaroons and various other items. The macaroons were the best followed by the cheese cake.

Food - Mushroom soup and veg sushi were quite well made. Tried Japanese style Udon noodles along with Japanese curry and maybe it is a matter of taste but both the dishes had excess soya sauce making them salty and bitter. I was later told that the noodles should be paired with Yamakazi whiskey and the curry with Jasmine rice to counter the soya sauce taste. It sounded like a good advice but a little late for this time. For dessert, brownie with ice cream was ordered and it was easily the best item. Overall pricing is decent for the quality and ambience.

To submerge you in that majestic generation they have kept a black and white television set, radio and a landline with round dialling pad, milk cans, kettle, glass jars, and of course the attire of the waiters!! The old melodies make you just go wow!!

Coming to the food, we ordered Chicken Kabiraji and Macaroni Pink Grilled Chicken Pasta!!
Let's discuss each in an order.

Chicken Kabiraji was so tender and delectable that you will just forget about the surroundings and will just relish the flavour of kasundi with the awesomely fried cutlets dipped in beaten egg!!!

Next delicacy, Macaroni Pink Grilled Chicken Pasta. Remotely similar taste of pasta which I experienced was a long time back. The blend of red and white sauce will leave you speechless. The quantity was great for two.

The staff is very helpful. I really had a nice time staying here. The rooms was great... shower was perfect. They cleaned the room everyday.
As for the restaurant staff... i have to say that Pranika was very very polite and she gave me a good feeling. Anything i wanted she helped me with it. i can say that by far she made me feel at home. The only thing that was a little bit frustrating....was the fact that the wifi wasn’t working properly everywhere in the hotel. Maybe a little thing for the hotel management to work on.

Looks like this place is mainly for IT people as most of it is occupied by 3 batches ( 12+). Nothing great to say about the interiors, ambiance it is decent enough. I am the odd man out in the group being the only vegetarian, but will put in words what my colleagues said about the non veg food.

Veg: Not that great, we ordered Panneer tikka & palak sheek kebab for starters, Sabzi Nawabi Handi & butter naan for mains. Panneer is rubbery & not soft indicating it is not fresh. Palak sheek kebab is kind of bland with no taste & not cooked properly. As suggested by the staff, we opted for Sabzi Nawabi Handi which is a bad decision as the taste is not that good. Service wise, they took lot of time in getting our order which is a let down as well.

Non veg: Sikendari Raan is a standout dish whereas the other Murg Musallam is bland with no taste/spiceness to it. Same is the case with Yakhni Shorba which tasted like hot gravy water.

Have tried multiple dishes from this place so this is kind of a general review. 

The chicken biryani is their specialility. Large fragrant rice which are flaky and yet not oily provide a perfect blend with juicy chicken pieces. Only note is that they serve with one giant chicken piece in the biryani. Smaller pieces would make the biryani more manageable. The quantity is definitely something where even 4 people can easily enjoy a meal.

We tried their haleem too in this Ramzan and it was delicious. Creamy texture with generous chunks of mutton and a small spicy kick to the taste, something which I really prefer in my haleem. 

Avoid going for a dine-in given the crowd but for home delivery, this is a place where you can order anything with eyes closed.

If you’re a person who would start off your clubbing night with some pop, electronic music and end it with proper punjabi dhol then this is the place for you.
AMazing Dj! He knew when to get the crowd exited.
I’ve tried their Long Island iced tea and Johnny Walker.
LIT was amazing.. one of the best I’ve had in the city.
Their chilly prawns was also yummy (not spicy enough for a Hyderabadi though)
Also, you get to try vape here! (Try their blueberry flavour, it’s dope)

The best part is they mention the name and place allocated on the entrance.

Ambiance is good and they welcomed with a mocktail.

Coming to starters, non veg was awesome and veg starters looked quite ok. But they can introduce something new as its same everywhere.

We have chicken wings, chicken kabab, fish, prawns. They were just amazing.

We have Tawa chicken and Prawns but that was not up to the mark and that Tawa items needs a huge change in taste.

Main course was above average and they had some amazing dishes like Laal Maas(mutton), prawns were awesome(love to visit again to eat this amazing prawns)

Coming to Desserts, they were just melting in mouth, my all time favourite Jilebi with Rabdi, asked for some hot Jilebi at the end as well, I got a few.
Kheer was ok, gulab jamun was good.

Went here on a Saturday evening for a couple of drinks and this place didn’t disappoint.

The place is a dimly lit bar scene overlooking the Biodiversity park signal, not crowded when we went there. We got ourselves into a table with good view of the city.

We tried Weissbeer and Mango Tango mocktail. The beer was a wheat beer, which has similar taste of a draught beer you usually get but it was different in a good way.Mocktail was pulpy and sweet. Overall Drinks were 👍

To go along with the drinks we ordered charcoal spiced chicken and a folded cheese omelette. The chicken starter was good with perfect amount of spice perfectly burnt to get that charcoal feel. The cheese omelette was just good with little cheese as my expectations were high. Overall Food was good.

The service was quick and prompt(maybe due to less crowd when we went) and no issues there.

They also gave a plastic fork to eat a salad which has chicken, cucumber, lettuce, capsicum and tomato.

1655,"This has been on my list for a while now, but for some reason, hadn't been able to make it there until recently. Went in for Lunch with my colleagues. Was impressed by the level of activity at this place, serving huge nos of online orders from a rather small kitchen (housed in a food court).

We ordered Mutton Galouti Kebab, Veg Seekh Kebab, Paneer Kadhai, Butter chicken, Dal Tadka, Tandoori Rotis and Jeera Rice. The Mutton Kebab was delicious - the 'melt in the mouth and leave you wondering' kind - only possible improvement was that they could have made it a bit less salty - strictly nitpicking.

The veg seekh Kebab arrived slightly late and was not as good as the Mutton, but still held a good taste. The star for us was the Butter chicken. Slightly tangy, moderately spicy, slightly sweet, incredibly smooth and buttery, with huge pieces of chicken. I was bowled over..! So impressed was I, that the Paneer kadhai, which was actually more than decent and very tasty, failed to capture my attention..! The Dal and the rotis were good, but paled in comparison with the magic of that Butter chicken. The only less impressive dish among the lot was the Jeera rice, which was almost devoid of all flavours except salt - could have been better.

In all, a very good experience. I cant say Value for money, but the food was impressive in general. Worth more visits, any day..! Thanks.

We ordered Basque Chicken Sandwich and Very Cheesy Panini accompanies with an Iced Latte. 

The chicken sandwich was delicious with crispy sourdough bread and juicy chicken inside. The bread tasted fresh and the sourness was accentuating the flavors. Served with crispy potato wedges and a coleslaw, the whole meal is quite filling.

The very cheesy panini was prepared with wholewheat bread and had a distinct cheese flavor to it. It could have worked with a little more spice but that doesnt meant the flavors were any less. 

Both the sandwiches were gulped down with the iced latte served in a tall glass.

Service was quick and the ambiance was pleasant with good music on play. 

Althought a bit on the pricier side, the menu offers a lot of variety and the place is recommended for their signature sandwiches prepared with their home baked bread.

9495,"It took me so long to pen down this review, 6 days to be exact! And why you ask. Well that's because I had to taste 6 donuts in all.

Yess, I decided to try the festive Rakhi donut box that comes with 6 mini Donuts ranging from death by chocolate, chocolate filled, mango flavored, two classics, etc. All this priced at Rs 199 plus taxes. This roughly came out to Rs 243.

So much goodness in one box!

Now I can't name each of the Donuts but I can say that majority were chocolate based. Of the 6 donuts, 2 were classic style and rest 4 were filled ones.

The first one was the classic sugar coated. Simple and goody good.

The second one was a chocolate coated classic donut. This one was fine.

Next up the mango flavored one. This one had a mango glaze on top and center filled with mango puree or jam. This was a fresh taste after so much chocolate.

The fourth one I think was death by chocolate. This one had a delicious chocolate coating on top and center filled with gooey chocolate.

The fifth one had a chocolate topping but cream filling. This one was ok.

The last one again had a chocolate topping and a vanilla filling. This one was good. The topping had some sprinkles too.

All in all a sinful treat for all donut heads out there.
Definitely a must try.

Breaking away from my usual style of writing I will come to the location and ambience after the food.
So this outlet is located on the ground floor of SLN terminus. Very easy to locate. The board is visible from the road.

9653,"I am a huge fan of regional cuisines. The diversity in our regional cuisines exhibits so much about the range India possess. It also talks about the immense depth in terms of culture and it’s just a festival of flavors. Cities especially witness the change in the culture and places like Hyderabad is an amalgamation of so many from the Nizams, Rayalseema to telugu cuisines.

Hyderabadi Dawaat is one such place which is trying to restore the age old tradition and bring back the cuisine of Nizams. From slow cooked Raans to delicious Biryanis, the menu for the place is full of culinary delights and I was really excited to go for it.

As I went in for a dinner, we started with a serving of a traditional Yakhni Shorba, a great start to the meal. With every sip, the intense flavor starts to get you. Then there was an array of appetizers that really got me. We had the Achaari Paneer Tikka, where pieces of paneer were marinated in a flavorful tangy achaari mix. For the non vegetarians, we had Murgh Kalmi Kebab where the chicken leg pieces were marinated in a balanced spice mix. The Gosht Seekh Kebab was wonderful as well. It was juicy mutton kebabs and lastly the Patrani Fish. The fish was perfectly cooked and the flavors of coconut cream enhanced the taste.

The restaurant also took the pain to present us their special Sikandari Rann, where a whole leg of lamb is marinated with whole spices and then cooked in a tandoor. It was served on a bed of fried onions, garlic with some Mutton Shami Kebabs on the side. Every single element from that whole ensemble stood out for me and made my day. Moreover, there were also some Persian Chelo kebabs and Murgh Mussallum for us to enjoy, served along with their range of condiments.

 The Rann was not enough and the restaurant decided to bring more stuff for us. We had Gosht Masala, Achari Chicken and Nargisi Kofta all of which was served alongside with some piping hot Stuffed Kulchas and flaky Garlic Naans. The Nargisi Kofta was my favourite of the night. It just had the right balance of flavors and made me go gaga over it. The Gosht Masala was spicy but the Achari Chicken was incredible too. Desserts like Gil-e-Firdaus and Fruit Salad marked the end of our meal.

633,Ordered bread omelette with roast potato wedges and it failed to impress me. By bread omelette I was expecting bread wrapped with omelette but it was separate. Omelette tasted good. Bread was plain and hard. There were only two normal/medium sized roasted potato wedges. It tasted ok. Along with wedges were two chunks of roasted potato. English style and all is good but it is important to know how people eat a particular vegetable in a region. Neither one likes to chew a whole tomato nor one is capable of gulping it down. This was a major let down. There was rajma type curry which tasted ok. This whole dish was out of the way.,neutral,restaurant

2922,"Its a small joint located near the DLF IT Park. Well who doesnt love Maggi and thats what draws you towards the outlet. You can either visit the place or even place order online. I have tried both methods with varying experience. 
I visited the outlet and Maggi i tasted was much better than when i ordered for home delivery. So one thing probably with Maggi is that you will relish it most of it is prepared and consumed hot without letting it dry. 

Double Egg Chicken Maggi - not as i would have expected it to be 
Double Masala chicken Maggi - definitely worth a try 
Chicken fried Maggi is my personal favorite 

Overall a nice small joint to satisfy your maggi cravings, would suggest order online if you live closeby.

Ordered few Kababs, Biriyani, Nan, Panner

Quantity is good.
Taste : We specifically told the manager to server less spicy items and my parents really liked the kabab items and a chicken main course.
Service : That time I think only 4-5 table filled. But they are very late in serving and the waiter even not listening after a multiple time about serving (e.g veg  or non-veg. No rice to parent). He just did what he thought. Then I started to serve till manger came for rescue..ha ha... 1 star less for this. In one word it's un-professionalism.

Biryani's and more is one such place, where wide spread of biryani's are available. It has few outlet in Hyderabad, i visited to gachibowli outlet. It is located near biodiversity , beside care hospital gachibowli. This place is easily accessible, as it on main road. Its in ground floor of the building. Particular i wanted to this place, to taste some Biryani's, i have been here for dinner with group of friends.
Soon i went in, i was greeted by the friendly staff, and incredible aroma of biryani's from other diner's . We managed to snag our table.

Being settled down, we ordered few Mocktails
Mango lassi, as this is season of mango's❤️ , ginger lemon, ginger cola, lemon soda, sparkling blue. Each of the Mocktails looked picturesque.

Mango lassi and lemon soda were best out of all. Rest other Mocktails were good.

To start with dinner, we had soups👇🏻
Lemon coriander : this is a clear soup, along with some broccoli, carrot. Veggies gave us a delicious taste and it's a healthy soup to start with.
Chicken machow soup: fried noodles were added on top od chicken soup.

Appetizers:
We have order crispy veg, corn 65, apolo fish, tender chicken, bangla kodi, chilli prawns

Crispy veg: all vegetable (onions, potato, carrot) were deep fried.
It tasted average.
It can be better.

Corn 65: corn kernels were mixed with floor , and some ingredients, corn kernels are made in to balls and than deep fried, served with mayo.

Tender chicken, prawns are must try here.

Main course : avakya chicken biryani, afghani Biryani's , veg noodles

Veg noodles: vegetable in it makes the noodle to give crunchy texture, sauces gives us a distinctive flavour. Noodles were soft, somehow i liked the noodles here.
Afghani chicken biryani: it is one exclusive Biryani here, on top of biryani' they serve omlet.

We have ordered some Indian bread, with tomato Cashew, and chicken curry.
Tomato curry with Cashew was best one i had , so in Hyderabad.

One cannot end dinner without desserts:
We have ordered junnu, jamun, kurbani ka meeta. I liked the jamun here, it was soft and tasted yummy.

The early impressions were not great as it seemed very crowded and the ambiance wasnt bright which aroused a non positive vibe.. As we dint want to Go to another restaurant at that time.. We proceeded to have the buffet..

Except for the desserts section which was huge, I was disappointed with the overall quality of the food.. The taste want great and at the same time, the meat had a lot of bones.. service was bad..

The lovely place is properly situated at the prominent cross roads of Biodiversity, Gachibowli, right opposite to Nissan showroom. The place and its ambiance is quite cozy as the lighting is subtle and ambient which blends in pretty well with the interiors of the restaurant. The staff is exceptionally attentive and a special shout out to Mr. Sudhir for completely taking care us and treating us with an excellent dinner.

As soon as we sat down, we were greeted enthusiastically with mocktails. A group of six food enthusiasts promptly ordered six diverse mocktails namely Sparking blue, Mango lassi, Ginger cola, Ginger lemons, Virgin mojito, Masala cola. Out of all the mocktails, Masala cola and mango Lassi stood out and were the best. The other mocktails were equally good and refreshing.

Delicious appetizers:

Crispy Veg: A variety of vegetables deep fried and garnished with aromatic flavors was something that wasn’t new that we didn't have, but it tasted excellent!

Corn 65: It tasted absolutely delicious. Corn balls deep fried and then garnished with mayo to give the 65 feel! Thoroughly recommended.

Bangla Kodi: Which was a signature dish of the restaurant, but for us it was a dish that also stood apart.

Chilli prawns: Spicy, stirred fried, It tasted awesome.

Tender chicken: The star of the appetizers. Brest chicken fillets dipped and fried with bread crumb batter. Highly recommended, please don't miss out on this dish.

Apollo fish: So it was a fish. Apart from that about the taste was okays’ish.

Main Course:

Chettinad Chicken: Very Spicy and it went absolutely well with the butter naan.

Kolhapuri Chicken: Mild flavours, the taste was good!

Uluvacharu Chicken Biryani: This was the highlight of the dinner, unique taste and flavors, the restaurant lived up to the name of Biryani, Highly Recommended.

Avakai Chicken biryani: A novel kind of taste for me and I really liked it.

Afghani chicken Biryani: Mild flavor biryani topped with Egg-omelet, It tasted really good.

Desserts:

Qubani ka meetha, Junnu and Gulab Jamun were served to us and we were extremely dissatisfied with the desserts. I earnestly request the effective management to please look into the dessert part. Everything else made it a great evening to hang out with family and friends for good Indian biryani Flavours.

This is my go to place when I randomly decide to go out to grab some brewed beer. I don't remember how many times I have been here. On the 10th floor, the view from the outdoor seating is beautiful, the indoor is nice and lavishly yet elegantly decorated, though I personally like outdoors. The dance floor is a little small but hey the DJ has to be good right!!

With their whole ranged of brewed beers - 4 different samples to try out and one can order a sample of all to taste and decide. I like ale above all. We combined it with honey chilli potato, dahi ke kababs, baby corn tempura.
Honey chilli patao has great spicy and sweet balance but a bit of onion to the fry would have made it a best dish.
Dahi ke kabas were good to taste with the green chutney.
Lasagne is good and pasta is so so and I didn't like it that much. Food is average here but a glass of beer and one won't mind. Wines are not that great too so go for beer 😜

The staff is good and friendly. The price is a bit on expensive side I would say. There are minimal cover charges for the pub. The embience is feel good and enjoy the night away kinda so it's fun.

The DJ is amazing and I always had great time shaking my leg on the floor. So it's a must go if u still haven't been here. 😍",neutral,restaurant

The nachos were crisp and came with delicious toppings of salsa and cream cheese. The chicken dishes were delicious and each had its own distinct taste. The chicken pieces themselves were quite chunky and juicy. We really liked chicken drums of heaven with its crunchy outer covering from the batter and juicy inside. 

Overall, the dishes were a must try. With a large menu and varieties, I know I'll be coming back here again for sure to try their signature fish, prawns, and lobster fare.

2178,"This was on my list since few months and finally we went for a Sunday buffet.
Ambience is good with cool music and performance.
Service ok.
Food not satisfied.
My review is only on vegetarian food.
Starters:
There were 5 veg starters. 2 paneer, crispy corn, cheese poppers and mixed veg. Crispy corn was disappointing and others were good.
Live counter:
Dosa was OK and Gobi paratha was good.
Main course:
I couldn't taste noodles as the dish was not refilled even after waiting for sometime.
All the gravy items were OK.
Deserts:
The dishes were Mysore Pak, kaaja, banana in hot jaggery liquid, kaju burfi, one type of laddu, apple crunch, answer kalakand.
Kaju burfi had more sugar and others were ok. When I called to the restaurant they said that they will have approximately how 100 items but I couldn't find even 40 vegetarian items there. I booked buffet in dineout offer. So, it was good deal for me. In general, I felt 1300 for buffet with this spread and taste is expensive.",neutral,restaurant

3861,"When I entered the place I was impressed with the interiors and how huge the place was. What I really liked about the place was that it has a good veg menu as well. We had ordered for a Mac n Cheese Steak. I felt all the items on the plate were dry items be it the grilled vegetables or the Patty or The Pulao Rice, there should’ve been some kind of gravy or dip with these items or else the dish tasted good. We had also ordered for a Spaghetti Aglio Olio. So the Spaghetti that they serve here is wheat spaghetti we didn’t really like how it tasted. When we informed the management about the Spaghetti, they immediately changed it with Spinach Ravioli. The Ravioli tasted really nice, the rich garlic flavour of this dish with pine nuts was a perfect blend.

Over all the experience was a really nice. Definitely a must visit.",neutral,restaurant

4086,"So, we decided to have some grub on a Monday afternoon and dashed off to Frio Bistro for no particular reason. There were not many customers around and that definitely helped us get some attention but the service was OK. We carefully curated our order - Chimichuri Pan Fried Fish, Lamb Ravioli and Andhra Pepper Chicken Pizza. I must say the food tasted authentic and delicious.

Chimichuri Pan Fried Fish, the chef's special, came with fish boasting a tangy and spicy herb crust, salsa, sauteed spinach and scallion rice. It was easily the best dish we ordered. The Lamb Ravioli was creamy but we were searching for the minced meat therein. Then came the spicy Andhra Pepper Chicken Pizza. It generated some interest despite diminishing appetite by then.

All in all, the place did come across as expensive for the items and portion sizes but worth a visit.

I hope that this is one of those cases and there wouldn't be other customers facing the same issue given the brand they own.",neutral,restaurant
1111,"I am a big fan of BBQ nation since a decade now. This however was my most dissatisfying experience to date, after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past.

The only thing they handled well, from the word go was the seating. I booked a table for 14 from zomato. It was ready for us when we arrived.

Everything else seemed to be falling apart, their team was struggling to deliver.

The starters took forever to be served. Most of them tasted similar though were called different things, refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things. The mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this, some were duly replaced.

The chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes. When we held our ground, he went back to personally create some dishes. His version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then.

I would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table.

Hope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together.",neutral,restaurant

9684,"Hyderabadi Cuisine as such is vast and rich in heritage with its deep roots into the tradition(s) like any other cuisine. Generations after generation, the cuisine has transformed into more commercial and all we know is few kebabs and dum biryani are the cuisine as such. But there is more than just biryani and kebab(s). Once you get to taste real authentic dishes, you will tend to know the richness and diversified delicacies from the land of Nizams. You always tend to get such delicacies towards the other part of the city and what the Cyberabad gets its morphed or rather mostly morphed delicacies. Wait no more as kondapur-gachibowli has got what it has been missing for quite a while. Hyderabadi Daawat opened up recently has a clear agenda of serving authentic dishes to commercial crowd and give them more above and beyond than the regular kebab(s) and biryani. 

My dinner session today had no expectation(s) from it but then the food spoke for itself. Restaurant should be proud to serve some delicacies which you don't get that easily anywhere in vicinity.

Dishes like #MurghMussalam , #MurghKalmiKebab, #CheloKebab, #PatraniFish, #GoshtMasala, #SikanderRaan and many more. While a few dishes went amiss to excite me, all other dishes were completely unique flavors and not quite relatable to palate that's used to typical tandoor/kebab(s). 

Must Try : #AchariChicken, #GoshtMasala, #KalmiKebab, #PaneerAchari, #DalAkbari and #NargasiKofta

Do focus on such rare delicacies when you go dine there and avoid the regular run around the mill dishes and I'm sure you will appreciate the restaurant for bringing you the heritage of culture rich Hyderabadi Daawat Cuisine. I'm definitely impressed with the menu offerings and their service (Mainly Mr. Dilawar was so gracious)

So we just planned out of the blue, to go to a place. Mustang was on the way and we stopped there. Since it was a weekday, we got the top most seating. **Yeah, they have 3 levels of seating. And even the music was not too loud.
Addition to this, coincidentally it was an almost full moon. Everything was set for 'yeh raatein yeh mausam... No 'nadi ka keenara'😣, but there was 'chanchal hawa' 😬

Too dramatic??- I know 🤣
Anyway, so we had the topmost seating, and had this amazing, unobstructed view of the clean dark sky with an almost full moon. Could see the road stretched alongside with redlamps of cars.
Don't exactly remember the name of the cocktail, but I think it was wallbanger. And it will get you to bang the wall. 😜 Didn't have food, so can't comment. But from other tables, it was smelling delicious. A bit heavy on the pockets. But for the view it provides, worth it.

So, if it's all so good, y one star less? Here goes the answer. All was well until we were about to head out and I decided to go to the little girls room. And guess what..!! I got locked from outside 😭. Though, after I knocked on the door 3-4 times, they did open it, but how much ever I spent on the cocktails, was drained out with my conscious mind shaking me up with the realization that I was locked.

CUCUMBER n MINT very refreshing to beat the heat n taste was good too

VIRGIN PINA COLADA not good as it had coconut n pineapple flavor n I'm not a fan of coconut flavor especially in drinks,so it was a No No for me

BLACK CURRANT tasted good

SPICY TANGO had a tinge of masala like jaljeera n a dash of spiciness dat had a pinching sensation on the throat.....little different n can be taken

CHILLI CHICKEN
Chunks of boneless chicken coated with batter n fried till golden brown,tossed in a chilli soy based sauce with onion,cubed capsicum,dry red chillies n spring onion stalks topped with handful of cashews n raw cabbage.....overall tasted very good n chicken was perfectly cooked n the sauce that was coating it was fab too...

Crunchy corn topped with some garlic n onions is the best of anything that one could possibly desire for........ if you love crispy corn then u you cannot miss this.....it was a fantastic appetizer to start our meal with.......do not miss this guyzz 👍

THAI BASIL CHICKEN WINGS
When chicken wings are coated in a delicious schezwan style thai chilli garlic sauce with a touch of basil leaves u get an awsome result.....it was very different kinda wings which we don't usually get at other places.......delicious

CHICKEN WONTON
Minced chicken filling wrapped in wonton sheets served with sweet chilli dip......filling had a quite dominant flavor of vinegar otherwise it was fine.....

DRAGON PRAWNS
Crispy fried prawns tossed in red chili n garlic sauce

BUTTER GARLIC PRAWNS

Jumbo is also a small word to describe the size of these prawns....whoa mahn!!!!
Tiger prawns was the right name given to this dish as the prawns sized huge....tossed in a very basic garlic,salt n pepper sauce served on a bed of blanched spinach topped with lemon wedge.....it was a bit hard but other than that the flavors were good

DAL TADKA
Well blended with perfect tempering of dry red chillies,chopped garlic,cumin seeds n oil.....was one of my favorite from the main course items.....delicious

When a warm choco lava cake is topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream drizzled with loadz of chocolate sauce n dusted with powdered sugar den there is nothing else u want in ur life😋

It was almost full we hardly get space for standing.
They occupied huge space and designed interior amazingly which definitely deserve a cover charge as its into business but one thing which nowhere make sense to taking 500 bucks for just entry out of 2k when every items price also decent to take your business ahead.
We could not order any snacks except one as we had to carry on hand and could spoil our party mood.
I must say either they should revoke their concept of charging for entry or should be take responsibility to offer seats atleast when you are visiting as couple or in group.

9239,"Had an amazing brunch at Collage, Hyatt Hyderabad.

I generally stay away from clicking pics at a buffet unless it’s something on our table but we were smitten by the desserts so much that I couldn’t resist clicking them. Each dessert was an amazing piece of craftsmanship, delicately plated and arranged (esp for something at a buffet).

The food and spread were equally awesome. There was Sushi 😍, Mexican 😍, Indian, Asian and Pizza.

The Mexican spread was plenty with nachos being my favorite as they came with lot of sides like guacamole, salsa, mango salsa and Parmesan. Didn’t explore the Asian side much but they had steamed veg and chicken momos. The live counters consisted of pindi chole, several types of paranthas, appam & stew.

The sushi was good but not great, especially the wasabi didn’t have a strong flavor. But being a buffet we were still satisfied with what they had.

The ambiance was really pleasant initially when we were seated. Later when we started sweating though we realized we were seated at a bad table as it was nearer to the door leading to the outside dinning area and that is where they also placed their live counters. Although they could close the door it was constantly getting opened and no one bothered to close it.",neutral,restaurant

We had booked a table via Nearbuy and were eager to embraced the experience of the world class hospitality, variety of dishes and a great ambience. But somehow, we don't know all that excitement was dipped a bit when we started experiencing it. It is maybe because of our exaggeration or it wad just like that, we don't know.

When I retrospect back home, I thought that it was due to the inattentiveness of the staff there. Not that they were rude but they didn't care much. The manager was busy boasting the foreign customers who were dining beside us.

Well, coming to the dishes, we had a nice sumptuous dinner. The best part was the dessert section. If had a variety of spreads. It was as if the whole chocolates in the world were right in front of the eyes.
Oh, boy! I had a ball.

Had the staff had been a little attentive, I'd have rated an easy 4.0! I guess they neglected us because we bought vouchers from the Nearbuy. But we've been too many 5-star hotels earlier using the voucher but never were treated differently.

Tried Coffee hazelnut shake - must say the coffee is neither mild nor overpowering, just the right amount and was good. It's loaded with whipped cream topped with choco chips.

Caramel Brownie shake--- now this is a stealer. Would give a 5 just for this. Probably the best caramel shake I ever had. Total yumminess. Even the colour is drool worthy. A must try here. Yes the sugar content is high and too sweet. Some pampering for your sweet tooth.

Was with a friend where we had a good conversation.
Had a couple of beers, thanks to gold membership :p
Ordered roasted chilli prawns which was good
Had chicken lasagna pasta which was very heavy, we couldn't finish it, it tasted good as well.
Over all, a budget free and a nice place.
Because of summer, you might feel hot in there after a couple of drinks, but a good place, might visit again.",neutral,restaurant

There was a set menu, Welcome Drink(very refreshing) tomato Shorba(passable),crispy paneer, chicken tikka (both were very yummy) , butter chicken, paneer butter masala( both passable) , daal fry (yummy) roti (soft) and steamed rice.The pasta in white sauce was good.. But the absolute let down was the pan seared fish with tomatoes. The fish was not done properly, no crispy skin and was a bit smelly. There was ice-cream too.. The service was amazing and so was the ambiance.",neutral,restaurant

5250,"Ambiance(3/5):
The place is simple and sober, nothing fancy. 

Food (4/5): 
Chicken 65: It has strong garlicy and gingery aroma. Medium spicy, soft boneless starter. 
Paneer Tikka: Smoky soft paneer 
Ulvachuru Biryani: Yummy . Rice along with some red colored gravy gave it a nice juicy touch. However they used regular rice, we were expecting basmati rice. 

Moderately priced. ~800 for the above three dishes. 
Quick service and courteous staff.",neutral,restaurant

1881,We have visited this place multiple times for lunch. It had now become our go to restaurant for casual team lunches.. The pub lunch menu has quite a few options to choose from and all the items are pretty good. You also get a glass of her or wine or a mojito to choose from. The moon drinkers also have an option to go for a soup or chose a cold drink with the food.. The best part is the food and the service has been consistently good!!!!,neutral,restaurant

1129,This place is good when you come empty stomach... Just kidding . Barbeque Nation have been always my favorite when it comes to barbeque and their amazing mocktails and juices as they keep innovating the menu and the deserts. Has a lag in my order when I had been there last time but I guess it may be because of the high intensity of people who come and dine. A very good place with very welcoming staff.,neutral,restaurant

1508,I have ordered from here using the Zomato app. The ordering was simple. They responded very fast and I had the food delivered within 30 minutes of the order. This was a happy experience. The burgers were very good and the chicken legs still warm and succulent. The rice with small chicken nuggets was also excellent though the quantity seems to be a little less.,neutral,restaurant
1892,Really good place in gachibowli. Ambience is average. But good place with good vibes and crowd. They have their own brewed beer with taster pack available. Open area is good to enjoy a nice breeze and good view of the area. They have a dance floor. There are karaoke nights as well. On weekends there might be cover charges and would suggest going in couples to avoid stag fees. Entry is from side in the building SLN terminus. lunch menus are bad. Food is just average here. Most of the gravies taste same and brown in color. Overall worth a visit. Good place to enjoy music and have fun.,neutral,restaurant

2514,"Ambience and location is nice. But nice to hangouts only in group and a girl is mandatory to be in group. Else entry will be denied. Thumbs down for stag. Starters are good but main course is really horrible. Very small portion of drinks specially when they see you are busy in chatting or talking. The staff is polite but you have to chase them multiple times for taking orders. You can have opt for this only when all other nearby places are full. The complete street is full of restaurants and can be given priority.
You might see lot of positive feedbacks but most of them are done just to get a free ice cream. Yes, they offer free ice cream if you write good reviews for them. Luckily I don't like vanilla flavour so will write what I felt.",neutral,restaurant

3855,"It's a must try place in Hyderabad. Located in boulder hills, this place is spacious and has a golf course in vicinity. The USP of the place is definitely the ambience. The large open area and also the pricey bar counter stacked with expensive liquor. Ideal place for a romantic candlelit dinner. The place reverberates the screech of birds at night and the experience is surreal. We ordered pizza and chicken wings and a couple of drinks. Food was average but the ambience is mind blowing",neutral,restaurant

We ordered crispy salt and pepper vegtables as a starter which was a good portion size and enough for two people to share.
For main course we went with the recommendation of paneer lababdar with garlic naan. The quantity was enough for two people and the paneer lababdar was medium spicy. It was made just like how it is made in the North.
